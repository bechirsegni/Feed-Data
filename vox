[<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-h/\">AP / Suzan Fraser</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"9MLcRu\">Dozens of the victims were children.

[<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-o/\">The Guardian / Constanze Letsch</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"1RdrAy\">The Turklsh government blames ISIS for the attack. They haven't claimed responsibility, but it's plausible; similar tactics have been used in other ISIS-linked suicide bombings in Turkey, and ISIS has targeted Kurds to inflame Turkish/Kurdish tensions. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-b/\">Reuters / Orhan Coskun and Daren Butler</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"wDNs7V\">But Turkey also has a habit of being overly hasty in blaming groups for terrorist attacks (often to suit its own political ends). The government has already walked back its initial claim that the bomber was a 12- to 14-year-old child himself. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-n/\">BBC</a></strong>]</li>\n<li>Turkey's foreign minister has promised to \"completely cleanse\" the region of ISIS, and provide cover to moderate rebels.

Bill and Chelsea Clinton would also leave the foundation. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-c/\">BuzzFeed News / Ruby Cramer</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"PGzwvJ\">The foundation announced over the weekend that if Clinton is elected, it will stop taking foreign and corporate donations. But the new announcement makes it clear that the foundation would have relatively minimal overlap with a Clinton White House. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-q/\">CNN / Dan Merica and Eric Bradner</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"N0rVFJ\">It wasn't a moment too soon. New emails from Hillary Clinton's secretary of state tenure, released today as part of a lawsuit from a conservative group, reveal some possibly shady contacts between the foundation and the State Department — depending on your interpretation. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-a/\">WSJ / Rebecca Ballhaus</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"TlHM1e\">Whether you think it was shady for, say, the prince of Bahrain to pester the foundation to get him a meeting with Clinton after he'd gone through \"normal channels\" (as opposed to simply impatient) might depend on how you feel about the Clintons. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-f/\">Foreign Policy / John Hudson</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"aEb2yy\">But the real problem with the foundation ties, as with many Clinton ethics scandals, isn't outright corruption — it's judgment. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-z/\">Vox / Jeff Stein</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"kAJTgv\">The Clinton Foundation has undeniably done good work.

[<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-v/\">Laura Seay via Twitter</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"Xbw4Bw\">But even Clinton allies have felt for some time that, regardless of its actual work, the fact that the foundation provides such an easy <em>appearance </em>of corruption makes it hard for the Clintons to ask America for its trust. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-e/\">NY Mag / Jonathan Chait</a></strong>]</li>\n<li>Arguably, the new announcements about the foundation show the Clintons are finally learning that lesson.

Terry McAuliffe announced Monday that he's restored voting rights to 13,000 felons, circumventing an order from the state's Supreme Court. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-yd/\">Washington Post / Laura Vozzella</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"4rK2wc\">Virginia has some of the harshest disenfranchisement laws in America — stripping people of the vote even years after they've returned to society. Twenty percent of the state's black men are disenfranchised. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-yh/\">Sentencing Project</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"j9jENc\">McAuliffe's Republican predecessor, Bob McDonnell, tried to soften state law but was rebuffed by the GOP-dominated legislature. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-yk/\">Voting Rights Watch</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"2Pfhj8\">When McAuliffe tried to use his clemency powers to restore voting rights to 200,000 felons en masse, though, it became a political battle — and the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that clemency powers didn't allow for such a broad policy shift. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-yu/\">Vox / German Lopez</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"7xNL0h\">So McAuliffe's administration has started signing voting restoration orders individually. The 13,000 is simply the first batch.</li>\n<li id=\"JkEC5Z\">Yes, McAuliffe is a longtime Clinton ally, and this is an election year. But Virginia is hardly a swing state anymore (Clinton's up by more than 11 points in the RealClearPolitics polling average), so this isn't exactly a move of political desperation. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-jl/\">RCP</a></strong>]</li>\n<li>It might not even end up changing much on Election Day. Many of the Virginians who might be affected (at least one of whom is hoping to run for office himself) are still confused about when they'll get their voting rights back, and how. [<strong><a href=\"http://newsletters.vox.com/t/d-l-idykkhd-l-jr/\">CityLab / Brentin Mock</a></strong>]</li>\n<li id=\"YlPZxo\">But it's a useful illustration of how clemency powers can be used in a bold, broad way — something the Obama administration, which has been slowly getting less cautious in granting clemency, might want to note.

The&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=78545\">party platform</a> that year said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The same human economic activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. While the scope and long-term consequences of this are the subject of ongoing scientific research, common sense dictates that the United States should take measured and reasonable steps today to reduce any impact on the environment. Those steps, if consistent with our global competitiveness will also be good for our national security, our energy independence, and our economy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to John McCain, Republicans like Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, and even Sarah Palin agreed that taking action to mitigate climate change was a conservative thing to do. When business leaders published a letter in 2009 explicitly calling for climate legislation,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/9/11895578/donald-trump-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">guess who signed it</a>.</p>\n<p>So what happened? How did it become politically risky for Republicans to talk about the challenges climate change will pose to global health and security? How did they go from listening to experts to accusing them of conspiracies?

The 42-year-old black mother from Little Rock, Arkansas, once embodied the \"welfare queen\" stereotype burned into America’s collective conscience <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2013/12/linda_taylor_welfare_queen_ronald_reagan_made_her_a_notorious_american_villain.html\">by Ronald Reagan</a>, which&nbsp;she both fit and shattered standing over Clinton’s right shoulder that day on the White House lawn.</p>\n<p id=\"K1qjni\">In Harden’s <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4536701/lillie-harden-speaks-life\">speech</a> at the signing ceremony, she spoke of using welfare while unemployed for two years, of her son \"pushing\" her to go back to work, and, finally, enrolling in one of Arkansas’s welfare-to-work reform programs Clinton initiated as governor in 1989, which she credited with helping her land a job at a supermarket.</p>\n<p id=\"fnSqKm\">\"When I got my job, my son was so proud of me,\" Harden said. \"But I made a deal with him. I told him, ‘I'm going to work every day and take my work seriously.’\"</p>\n<p id=\"17RFHl\">Through Clinton, Harden demonstrated a new era in which policy reform pushed personal reform to the benefit both of citizens and the government that served them. But 20 years later, does this image of Harden and the benefits of welfare reform still hold up?</p>\n<h3 id=\"nja8V1\">Harden symbolized black people taking \"personal responsibility\" for their poverty</h3>\n<p id=\"CioCWo\">Harden’s story was considered successful in large part because she calmed national anxiety that black women exploited welfare through the infamously racist stereotype of the (black) \"welfare queen.\"</p>\n<p id=\"lTzpBb\">The welfare queen idea was an enduring talking point for Reagan’s 1976 presidential run, years before Harden was unemployed in 1981. As Josh Levin <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2013/12/linda_taylor_welfare_queen_ronald_reagan_made_her_a_notorious_american_villain.html\">reported</a> for Slate, Reagan’s campaign recounted stories of elusive figures living in public housing with pools, practicing witchcraft while collecting food stamps. Reagan told America the story of Linda Taylor, a Chicago con artist who had, in fact, cheated the government of $8,000 by 1976, using four aliases (though<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/23/politics/weflare-queen/\"> he claimed </a>she used \"80 names\"), wearing a fur while driving a Cadillac to receive public assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"JJWSOs\">Discussions about welfare queens were fueled by racial resentment. Contrary to Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society, welfare <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/moneybox/2016/06/how_welfare_reform_failed.html\">had created chronic dependence</a> on subsidies like Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). But rather than adjust the policy or address the core reasons so many people were stuck in the cycle, the conversation focused largely on vilifying welfare recipients as corrupt drains on society, leeching off hard-working American’s tax dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"ptCEXh\">And even though white and black families made up similar numbers of<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/167036/3characteristics.pdf\"> AFDC cases</a> between 1983 and 1995, black women were the face of both welfare’s failure and the culprits who corrupted it, and an indictment of the Democratic Party that supported them.</p>\n<p id=\"vuQvxP\">Clinton, however, offered a different vision. After some back and forth with the GOP, the AFDC was effectively renamed the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Through <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/moneybox/2016/06/how_welfare_reform_failed.html\">block grants</a>, the policy required recipients to find a job two years after they began seeking benefits, and put a five-year lifetime limit on receiving benefits. Also among its goals was a push to promote two-parent households and marriage, drawing heavily from <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/moneybox/2016/06/how_welfare_reform_failed.html\">dubious ideas</a> that women were using out-of-wedlock births to cash in on welfare checks.</p>\n<p id=\"kQHoFk\">PWRORA helped Clinton effectively dismantle a social safety net for the poorest Americans with a program that incentivized them to seek work because there was little money invested in supporting them otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"HmOG9s\">Clinton also found a way to rebrand the political party he led by putting an end to the system championed by Democratic presidents before him. But he did so by following Reagan and other Republicans.</p>\n<p id=\"Mo8Bme\">Clinton drew the ire of liberals, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/why-it-matters-that-hillary-clinton-championed-welfare-reform/\">including</a> Mary Jo Bane, Wendell Primus, and Peter Edelman — prominent officials at Health and Human Services under his administration who resigned in protest.</p>\n<p id=\"Q3NQuK\">In a 1997 <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/03/the-worst-thing-bill-clinton-has-done/376797/\">Atlantic</a> essay titled \"The Worst Thing Bill Clinton Has Done,\" Edelman, a longtime friend of Clinton, lambasted just what was wrong with PRWORA: \"The bill closes its eyes to all the fact and complexities of the real world and essentially says to recipients, Find a job. That has a nice bumper-sticker ring to it. But as a one-size-fits-all recipe it is totally unrealistic.\"</p>\n<p id=\"fxbhU3\">A part of this was simply politics. Clinton entered the White House as a Democrat appealing to <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-10-28/news/9204070622_1_sister-souljah-bill-clinton-reagan-democrats\">\"white flight Democrats,\"</a> or those voters prepared to leave the party out of resentment for its growing alignment with the concerns of racial minorities. And like his infamous <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/1/12/10749984/hillary-clinton-pander\">\"Sister Souljah moment,\"</a> <strong></strong>welfare reform helped him capture racial resentment to his advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"AeQBBy\">In the 1990s, Clinton sought to champion both hard-working Americans and nonworking Americans alike by gutting government subsidies for the nation’s poorest, who, due to welfare, had little if any reason to work like their counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"IJDSgC\">But with Harden, Clinton did what his GOP counterparts couldn’t: advocate for welfare reform without completely alienating black constituents. By pushing personal responsibility, Harden helped Clinton chastise welfare without <em>completely</em> vilifying black women. Harden showed that the \"welfare queen\" could be redeemed, transforming the face of welfare’s alleged problems into the same fare of welfare reform’s promise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"l9fKWn\">Welfare reform failed to address systemic inequalities that still hurt black women</h3>\n<p id=\"KyrIpb\">Lillie Harden’s story may have been a triumph for Clinton’s welfare reform agenda. But in the decade after, her life showcased its undeniable limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"zIziZc\">Last year, for Alternet, journalist <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/tragic-end-woman-bill-clinton-exploited-poster-child-gutting-welfare\">Zaid Jilani</a><strong> </strong>tried to seek Harden, and found that she had died 12 years after she suffered a stroke in 2002, which left her&nbsp;unable to qualify for Medicaid or afford her bill for monthly prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"kBhrIk\">In <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=khvG8rDKAikC&amp;pg=PT268&amp;dq=lillie+harden&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uBpEVdrXL8yZgwTV1IHoDg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#harden&amp;f=false\">American Dream: Three Women, Ten Kids, and a Nation’s Drive to End Welfare</a></em>, Harden gave journalist Jason DeParle a different outlook on welfare reform: \"It didn’t pay off in the end.\"</p>\n<p id=\"8Qe7gh\">As Vox’s Dylan Matthew’s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform\">explained</a>, the success of Clinton’s welfare reform depends on  how one measures the goals. If it was to actually end welfare, then PRWORA was a victory. If the goal was to put an end to poverty, it’s hard to deny that it was an utter failure.</p>\n<p id=\"r7DIUr\">From 1993 to 2012, overall poverty dropped, particularly during the 1990s. However, Matthews noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That was true even in economic downturns. In 1993, as the nation recovered from the early 90s recession, the poverty rate was nearly 21 percent. In 2012, in the wake of the worst recession in post-WWII history, it spiked up to 16 percent, a huge improvement.</p>\n<p>The same can't be said of deep poverty [or those living on $2 a day]. That fell in the '90s too — but by a comparatively tiny amount. And by 2012, it was back fairly close to its 1993 level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div data-autotune-alt-embed-url=\"https://apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-change-in-poverty-and-deep-poverty-1993-to-2012/screenshots/screenshot_s@2.png\" data-autotune-alt-embed-type=\"image\" id=\"vox-change-in-poverty-and-deep-poverty-1993-to-2012__graphic\" data-analytics-label=\"vox-change-in-poverty-and-deep-poverty-1993-to-2012:2580\" data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\"></div>\n<p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\n (function() { var l = function() { new pym.Parent( 'vox-change-in-poverty-and-deep-poverty-1993-to-2012__graphic', 'https://apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-change-in-poverty-and-deep-poverty-1993-to-2012/'); }; if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') { var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0], s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/0.4.5/pym.js'; s.onload = l; h.appendChild(s); } else { l(); } })();\n// --></script>\n</p>\n<p id=\"8FrmSu\">Even today, black women like Harden remain extremely vulnerable to poverty. A 2013 <a href=\"https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SOW-factsheet-AA.pdf\">report</a> by the Center for American Progress found that African-American women comprise more than half (53.3 percent) of breadwinners in married black households. Nonetheless, black women’s poverty rate is nearly twice that of their white counterparts — 28.6 percent compared with 10.8 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"6mgX41\">Not only does this make black women more vulnerable to the effects of poverty, but without support, the families many of them lead are put at risk too.</p>\n<p id=\"N0zlDv\">Two decades later, Harden may be remembered as the face of welfare reform. But given the fact that welfare also failed her, Harden’s legacy shows the limits of perpetuating personal responsibility narratives to redress systemic issues.</p>\n<p id=\"l0nm10\">Harden reminds us that the poorest among us are not solely responsible for their plight, and regardless of political gains, welfare reform needs to include reforming the institutional conditions that make welfare necessary.</p>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x000000038f2cc8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a4b458 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12583376/welfare-reform-history-clinton-lillie-harden">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x00000003a49900 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a4b458 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 16:20:02 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000004bf8e80 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a4b458 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Lillie Harden was Bill Clinton’s welfare reform success story.

And recent cases have given the push for body cameras a lot more credibility.</p>\n<h3>Body cameras are meant to hold police accountable</h3>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">A body camera. (Win McNamee/Getty Images News)</p>\n<p>Body cameras are small devices, usually attached to the head or upper body of a police officer and used to record their day-to-day work. <a href=\"http://www.wolfcomusa.com/wolfcom_vision_police_body_worn.html\">Some cameras</a> have enough battery life for a couple of hours of recording, while <a href=\"http://www.taser.com/products/on-officer-video/axon-body-on-officer-video\">others</a> can last as long as 12 hours. The cameras generally run between $200 and $1,000.</p>\n<p>The main argument for body cameras is that they could hold police accountable for their actions. This has already proven true in several cases, such as&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/23/9020963/samuel-dubose-police-shooting-video\">the 2015 police shooting of Samuel DuBose</a> in Cincinnati, in which officers were caught lying about the shooting — saying that their lives were in danger when they really weren't. In the past, we could have been left with nothing but the police officers' word to go on.</p>\n<p>At the same time,&nbsp;the cameras could protect cops falsely accused of wrongdoing. In a 2014 case in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for example, a woman&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/22/7038731/body-cameras-police-officers-false-accusations\">claimed</a> that an officer had sexually assaulted her during a drunk driving stop. It turned out nothing of the sort happened — and the video proved it.</p>\n<p>The cameras \"have the potential to be a win-win situation,\" said Jay  Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union  (ACLU). \"A   lot of departments are finding that for every time they're used to   record an abusive officer, there are other times where they save an   officer from a false accusation of abuse or unprofessional behavior.\"</p>\n\n<p>Stanley argued the devices could pay for themselves. For one, the recordings could be used to fight off false charges that could lead to costly lawsuits or court settlements. The cameras could also encourage police, who would know their actions are being recorded, to behave better.</p>\n<p>In New York City,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/sites/advocate.nyc.gov/files/brief-nypd_body-worn_cameras-final_0.pdf\">a 2014 report</a> from the city's public advocate found that outfitting the entire police department with body cameras would cost around $33 million.  But in 2013, the city paid $152 million as a result of claims of police misconduct. If body cameras could reduce those claims by just one-fifth, the devices would pay for themselves.</p>\n<p>Ed Mullins, a sergeant in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and president of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SBANYPD\">the NYPD sergeants union</a>, is skeptical about body cameras, but he agreed the devices could benefit police and local governments in some ways. \"The city settles lawsuits because it's cheaper\" than taking them to trial, he said. \"There's a value there.\"</p>\n<p>The major question is <i>how</i> body cameras could be used to hold cops accountable.</p>\n<p>Who maintains and releases the footage — the police, who may have an interest in <i>not</i> showing the video, or someone else, like prosecutors or an independent agency? And who is going to pay for storing all of that evidence, which will need to go on a server somewhere?</p>\n<p>Should the video go out to the public right away? This could be a big problem for investigators: They often gauge the credibility of witnesses by using other evidence and testimony to verify what witnesses say. If witnesses can fact-check their own testimony with video footage, they could end up masking their dishonesty more easily — possibly skewing an investigation.</p>\n<p>Figuring out these types of issues — who oversees the video, and when it's released — will likely come slowly in the next few years, as more police departments adopt body cameras. But until then, they're open questions.</p>\n<h3>Body cameras may help reduce use of force</h3>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">A UK police officer shows off his body camera. (Yui Mok/WPA Pool via Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Since so few police departments have adopted the devices up to this point, the evidence surrounding body cameras is still hazy. But some of the early results are promising.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ojpdiagnosticcenter.org/sites/default/files/spotlight/download/Police%20Officer%20Body-Worn%20Cameras.pdf\">a 2014 report</a> for the Department of Justice, Michael White, a professor of criminology at Arizona State University, reviewed the slim evidence on body cameras and the experiences of police departments around the world. White found some major benefits to the devices, but he also outlined a few lingering unanswered questions and concerns.</p>\n<p>Most promisingly, the report found what seems to be a big early success in Rialto, California. Since 2012, all Rialto cops must wear body cameras. In the first year of the program, use of force by officers dropped 60 percent and citizen complaints declined by 88 percent.</p>\n\n<p>Similar findings applied to other cities with body cameras. In multiple places, there were drops in citizen complaints. In the Scottish city of Aberdeen, there were fewer assaults on officers. And anecdotal evidence suggested a civilizing effect in Phoenix.</p>\n<p>The problem, the report noted, is the studies were so bare in their findings that it's unclear how body cameras led to the decreases in bad behavior. Did citizens behave better because they were on camera? Did cops? A mix of both? The studies don't provide a full answer for the cause and effect.</p>\n<p>The research also indicated that body cameras assist in the resolution of citizen complaints against police, and may reduce the likelihood of false complaints against police. In the UK studies, body cameras appeared to reduce officers' paperwork, improve cops' ability to determine whether a crime occurred, and increase the chances of a case ending in a guilty plea instead of a criminal trial.</p>\n<div class=\"align-right\">\n\n<p class=\"caption\">A body camera on a UK police officer. (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)</p>\n</div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-014-9236-3\">One 2014 study</a>, published in the <i>Journal of Quantitative Criminology</i> after White's report, tested body cameras in a randomized controlled trial with Rialto police. After police began wearing body cameras, reported use-of-force incidents dropped by more than half. But some of this drop occurred during shifts in which officers didn't wear cameras; that could indicate body cameras caused a change in norms — and therefore use of force — across the department, or it could mean there was some other variable unaccounted for in the study that caused use-of-force incidents to decline.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/695110/239562558-COPS-Office-Report.0.pdf\">a separate 2014 report</a> by the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office, several police chiefs heralded the use of body cameras as a means to collect evidence.</p>\n<p>\"Oftentimes, we know that the suspect is repeatedly abusing the victim, but either the victim refuses to press charges, or there is simply not enough evidence to go to trial,\" Daytona Beach Police Chief Michael Chitwood told the COPS Office, which helps train and fund local police departments. \"The footage shows first-hand the victim's injuries, demeanor, and immediate reactions. … This means that we can have enough evidence to move forward with the case, even if the victim ultimately declines to prosecute.\"</p>\n<p>Based on White's review of the evidence and the other research, it's also unclear whether body cameras exacerbate citizens' concerns about privacy and whether recording citizens in traumatic situations can worsen the trauma of such an event.</p>\n<p>The research also didn't resolve concerns that body cameras could expose officers to \"unsolicited fishing expeditions by supervisors,\" which could open cops to punishment simply for making a dirty joke while a camera is recording. It also failed to establish just how much of an effect body cameras have on litigation against police.</p>\n<p>\"Independent research on body-worn camera technology is urgently needed,\" White wrote. \"Most of the claims made by advocates and critics of the technology remain untested.\"</p>\n<h3>There are real privacy concerns about allowing police to record everyone at all times</h3>\n\n<p>Skeptics and supporters of body cameras acknowledge they could benefit both police and the public, but skeptics are particularly concerned that the policies could be set up in a way that violates the privacy of the public and police officers.</p>\n<p>Mullins, for one, said he's worried that recordings from body cameras could harm an officer's day-to-day work. A confidential informant, for example, could be reluctant to talk to a cop who's wearing a body camera. That could make it harder for police to track down a suspect or do other regular work in the line of duty.</p>\n<div class=\"align-right\">\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Denver police demonstrate body cameras to media. (Craig Walker/Denver Post via Getty Images)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Another big concern for cops like Mullins is that the cameras could be used to go after police for petty or political problems. For example, an officer could end up getting in trouble for a dirty joke with his partner that was caught on camera. \"Police sense of humor is different from what the general public expects,\" Mullins said. \"Do I get chastised for making jokes? Things like that need to be clear, because, in any workplace, people joke.\"</p>\n<p>Similar concerns apply for the broader public. A lot of people could take issue with having their every move recorded simply because a police officer is around, even in a public setting. The privacy concerns are further exacerbated if an officer comes into a person's home, where the recording could present a clear violation of someone's right to privacy on private property.</p>\n<p>There's also concern the cameras could be used to aid prosecutions of civilians. Under current policy, the NYPD generally avoids charging anyone who knowingly submits a false claim against a police officer, because it could lead to a chilling effect among people who have legitimate complaints. But if cameras empower the public to go after police, Mullins argued it's only fair that the devices are also used as evidence to prosecute people who make false charges against police.</p>\n<p>\"When we're wrong, we pay the penalty,\" Mullins said. \"What happens when you're wrong? It's a question of fairness.\"</p>\n<p>Stanley, of the ACLU, acknowledged some of the privacy concerns in <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/police_body-mounted_cameras.pdf\">a 2013 report</a> for the ACLU. His proposed rules would require a police officer to disclose to people that they're being recorded, provide some leniency for when a cop needs to record, limit public access to footage when it's directly pertinent to a personal or public issue with police, and prevent footage, particularly recordings impertinent to an investigation, from being held for long periods of time. Stanley also added that some sort of independent body should be able to verify the policies are being enforced correctly.</p>\n<p>\"We don't want to see video not of any importance to the public being circulated for yuks among police officers or posted on YouTube,\" Stanley said. \"At the same time, video that is of public importance should be released.\"</p>\n<h3>Technological limits could hold down body cameras</h3>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">A police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, outfitted with a body camera. (Aaron Bernstein/Getty Images News)</p>\n<p>Beyond the concerns about policy, there are technological limits that could strain the implementation of body cameras and the effect they have on holding police accountable.</p>\n<p>The major concern is battery life. With the battery of some cameras lasting as little as two hours, it's possible that the cameras may not always be usable when police officers need them most. Or to conserve battery life, police might need to charge the cameras in their cars and only turn them on right before they confront a suspect or take some other action. That may not always be feasible in emergency situations.</p>\n<p>Todd Morris, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.brickhousesecurity.com/\">BrickHouse Security</a>, a company that makes body cameras, said it's a concern he hears from police officers around the country. \"They have this fear that if they've been mandated to wear a camera and then for some reason they're unable to push the button or forget to push the button, the absence of video evidence will be used as evidence against them that they did something wrong,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Based on some polls, police officers' concerns have some merit. In <a href=\"http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693026/BodyCam_Survey_Results.0.pdf\">a survey</a> of 526 people conducted by Morris's company, nearly 75 percent of respondents said they would think an officer is hiding something if an outfitted body camera isn't activated.</p>\n<p>Stanley, of the ACLU, said this problem could be alleviated by providing police officers with extra batteries. While a problem for now, he said it's also one that likely won't exist once the technology improves. Until then, officers will just need to be somewhat careful with their battery use.</p>\n<p>\"There's plenty of battery to record most of the serious incidents that any officer is likely to encounter in any shift,\" Stanley said, \"but not necessarily enough to record all of every shift.\"</p>\n<h3>The public strongly supports body cameras, but some police officers are skeptical</h3>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Ferguson's local government, led by Mayor James Knowles, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/16/6023481/michael-mike-brown-ferguson-body-cameras\">vowed</a> to look into body cameras for its police force after the Michael Brown shooting. (Scott Olson/Getty Images News)</p>\n<p>Despite the issues, the public is strongly behind police wearing body cameras.</p>\n<p>The BrickHouse Security survey found that more than 72 percent of respondents support body cameras, which holds up with&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/16/body-cameras-poll_n_7079184.html\">other</a> <a href=\"http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/3373-poll-utahns-think-cops-should-be-required-to-wear-body-cameras\">polls</a> around the country.</p>\n<p>The respondents to BrickHouse's survey, however, were mixed in how the cameras should be used and turned on. Fewer than half of respondents said the cameras should always be on as long as the officer is on duty. Nearly 29 percent said the cameras should only be on when an officer is interacting with a civilian, and roughly 5 percent said the cameras should be activated at the officer's discretion. The remaining respondents said officers shouldn't be allowed to wear body cameras.</p>\n<p>Generally, police departments are more skeptical of body cameras — but those concerns seem to ease over time as they see the potential benefits. For example,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theiacp.org/portals/0/pdfs/IACPIn-CarCameraReport.pdf\">a 2002 survey of police officers</a> suggested as many as 93 percent of misconduct investigations with dashboard camera evidence exonerated officers. (The high exoneration rate is based on officers' self-reports, so it could be an overestimate.) Similar results may be possible with body cameras.</p>\n\n<p>\"The departments that I've researched  that implemented cameras had an anti-camera atmosphere,\" said Mullins, of the NYPD. \"That  subsequently changed over a period of time when officers recognized they  were being cleared of allegations that weren't true.\"</p>\n<p>Morris, of BrickHouse Security, said he's sold \"thousands\" of body cameras to police officers, who are buying them voluntarily with their own money. \"Everyone's got a friend on the force who has been accused of saying something inappropriate, touching someone inappropriately, or doing something inappropriate,\" he said. Police officers \"can all identify with it, and they want to avoid it.\"</p>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004c6d2d0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x0000000391a1b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6113045/police-worn-body-cameras-explained">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x00000003918838 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x0000000391a1b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 15:05:00 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x000000038f7688 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x0000000391a1b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Police body cameras, explained">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x000000038ddd78 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x0000000391a1b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 15:05:00 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003877b90 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x0000000391a1b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x00000003876718 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003877b90 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="German Lopez">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x0000000387caf0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x0000000391a1b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6113045/police-worn-body-cameras-explained", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000004c6e630 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x0000000391a1b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/vox_rss/mp4_redirect?url=http://ak.c.ooyala.com/FzdHh1cDrUEzrAqqJZ-O-PyQD4m0Pb6Z/DOcJ-FxaFrRg4gtDUwOjFpaDowODE78S", @rel="enclosure", @type="video/mp4", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -  All">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000004a9a750 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 21:38:40 -0400>, @author=[], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000004aa5d30 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @entry=[...], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[], @xml_stylesheets=[], @feed_type="atom", @feed_subtype="feed", @feed_version="1.0", @version="1.0", @encoding="UTF-8", @standalone=false, @output_encoding=nil>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Content:0x0000000386c4e8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type="html", @src=nil, @xml=nil, @content="  \n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8-JIoPU8GgnNDFedN0fGxiDSbw=/567x0:3117x1700/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50480625/GettyImages-481701216.0.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n  <p>Donald Trump led a revolution on immigration within the GOP. He can’t stop it now.</p> <p id=\"R7I5es\">Donald Trump, equipped with a new campaign team and a national media desperate for a competitive horserace, is set to reboot his campaign this week with a return to the issue that launched him to political superstardom: immigration. </p>\n<p id=\"tahjq5\">The question is exactly what sort of reboot it will be.</p>\n<p id=\"FBn0w7\">The thing to understand about Trump is that immigration is not just a key issue for him; it is the thing that won him the nomination, it is the thing on which he has been remarkably consistent over the years, and it is the thing that may be his lasting impact on the party — even if he loses the presidency in November. </p>\n<p id=\"AlQ0Kv\">Trump talked about immigration <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9060427/nativism-research-immigration-trump\">in a completely new way.</a> While his predecessors in the Republican Party had drawn a sharp distinction between legal and unauthorized immigration, and focused on the idea that immigrants competed with citizens for jobs, Trump portrayed immigrants — particularly Latinos and Muslims — as threats to Americans’ safety and American values.</p>\n<p id=\"BYMrCc\">All of which makes it particularly odd that Trump’s own campaign has spent the weekend before “immigration week” signaling to political elites that the candidate might change one of his signature policy proposals: deporting the 11 million unauthorized immigrants currently living in the US, as well as, possibly, their US-born children. </p>\n<p id=\"NuguAI\">The hints have been subtle — designed for people who want Trump to pivot to a more “sensible” immigration policy, or for those who simply believe that Trump doesn’t actually believe anything to hear what they want to hear. And even as his campaign told CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday that whether Trump still wanted mass deportation was “to be determined,” the campaign’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/08/19/trumps-ugly-and-dishonest-new-tv-ad-shows-he-isnt-changing-a-thing/?utm_term=.0aeabc9ee5dc\">first ad of the general election cycle </a>recycled some of the darkest anti-immigrant themes and footage from his primary campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"HzsuVX\">But still, it’s not typical for the Trump campaign to tell elites what they want to hear at all. The immigration two-step was a characteristic move of the Mitt Romney-era GOP — the GOP that Trump gained as an enthusiastic following by showing up as hypocrites.</p>\n<p id=\"NhHFpB\">Immigration remade Donald Trump, turning him from a B-list celebrity into a major party presidential nominee, and Trump in turn is remaking the politics of immigration. But Trump doesn’t own the immigration issue or the movement he’s galvanized. His campaign may think it can use “immigration week” to finesse Trump’s own positions, but Trumpism — as it will outlast his candidacy — isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"R37QuS\">Is Trump planning to use “immigration week” to galvanize his base — or to throw it all away?</h3>\n<p id=\"GEDc3M\">When Trump overhauled his campaign’s leadership team earlier this month, it made perfect sense that they’d start the next phase of the Trump campaign with an “immigration week.” After all, Trump’s new campaign CEO Steve Bannon (as chair of Breitbart News) actually helped pave the way for Trumpian anti-immigration nationalism. </p>\n<p id=\"aJDJMn\">The new team was brought in to “let Trump be Trump”; what better way to do that than by returning to the issue that started it all, and the one on which Trump has always had the firmest footing?</p>\n<p id=\"KqcXNc\">But over the weekend before “immigration week,” two very strange things happened. First, members of Trump’s “Hispanic advisory group” left a private Trump Tower meeting believing — and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/in-major-reversal-trump-indicates-to-hispanic-leaders-openne\">telling reporters</a> — that Trump was not only going to soften his stance on deportations, but was considering allowing unauthorized immigrants in the US to get legalized. </p>\n<p id=\"2Zaj3d\">Some attendees told <a href=\"http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/trump-now-says-he-plans-to-legalize-some-undocumented-immigrants\">Univision</a> that Trump was planning to announce a new immigration plan that would grant immigrants legal status without citizenship. </p>\n<p id=\"EpMGTu\">Others told <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/in-major-reversal-trump-indicates-to-hispanic-leaders-openne?utm_term=.bbG86GQAn#.lf836GXeB\">BuzzFeed News</a> that the campaign was merely considering a “task force” to look at how to deal with the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in a “humane” manner. (In the past, Trump has said that mass deportation would be done “humanely.”) To the members of the Hispanic advisory group, who are all Trump supporters, this sounded like the beginning of a new openness to some sort of legalization “short of amnesty.” </p>\n<p id=\"pCwz0g\">In a statement after the advisory group meeting, the campaign denied that its immigration stance had changed. (Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a major Trump supporter and apparent influence on Trump’s thinking,<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/08/21/sessions-refutes-buzzfeed-trump-immigration-reversal-report-he-has-not-changed-his-view/\"> also denies to Breitbart</a> that any change in policy is taking place.)</p>\n<p id=\"HzAgYh\">Then, on Sunday morning, Trump’s campaign manager hinted that it would:</p>\n<div id=\"D8OI8L\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donald Trump campaign manager: A deportation force is \"to be determined\" <a href=\"https://t.co/7WPV9nIbGZ\">https://t.co/7WPV9nIbGZ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CNNSOTU?src=hash\">#CNNSOTU</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0iKQKPyXqT\">https://t.co/0iKQKPyXqT</a></p>— CNN (@CNN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN/status/767355825623031808\">August 21, 2016</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"qmsWmC\">Most of Trump’s supporters don’t read <a href=\"http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/trump-now-says-he-plans-to-legalize-some-undocumented-immigrants\">Univision</a> or watch CNN’s Sunday morning political talk show. The face the campaign is showing the general public hasn’t changed: Trump spent much of a Virginia rally on Saturday talking about immigrants, and the campaign ad he released last week recycles primary-campaign footage of an immigrant “invasion.” </p>\n<p id=\"twzlr4\">It’s pretty typical for Republican campaigns to take a hard line on immigration with the base, then signify to political elites that they don’t really mean it. (This is exactly the play Scott Walker tried to make in the primaries.)</p>\n<p id=\"ua1Tls\">But what’s typical for Republicans is anything but typical for the Trump campaign. Trump made a splash by enthusiastically telling Americans concerned about immigration that their fears were legitimate, without varnish and without weaseling. In doing so, he showed up Republicans like Walker as feckless — people who wouldn’t stand firm in speaking truth to elites. </p>\n<p id=\"M3rq0D\">It’s not clear that a pivot on immigration — or even just a hinted future pivot — will actually alienate Trump supporters, many of whom are fiercely loyal. But it would be a substantial blow to his core message: that he is a brutally honest man who doesn’t feel the need to moderate for political correctness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Vldi1m\">Immigration delivered the nomination to Trump</h3>\n<p id=\"EM9C3b\">It’s now tough to remember that when Donald Trump asserted that \"murderers\" and \"rapists\" were coming over the US–Mexico border during his campaign launch, it was just one in a barrage of outrageous lines. It only became the centerpiece of his presidential campaign — the message he's ridden all the way to the Republican nomination — when he realized he had struck a nerve.</p>\n<p id=\"b3CBaS\">He embraced it because liberals hated it: When <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/12/listening-to-donald-trump-swear-and-talk-politics-on-his-private-plane/\">Robert Costa</a> of the Washington Post asked him in mid-July how he settled on immigration as a central campaign issue, Trump replied \"they gave it to me\" — \"they\" being the media outlets and Latinos who started raising a fuss. But he's stuck with it, and it's helped win him the nomination, because many conservative voters love it.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A man at a Trump rally waves a sign that says &quot;I'm ready to work on the wall&quot;\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75efKgWx88iKdFVmajPvDWJ_g5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6114665/GettyImages-511281150.jpg\">\n      <cite>Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"rl1J8d\">The message he found won a real and intense emotional response from some groups of Americans — powering him to the top of the Republican primary race. His rivals in that race almost uniformly at one time or another supported some version of “comprehensive immigration reform” (CIR). This was a long-time legislative concept that sought to reconcile the interests of long-time undocumented residents of the United States with the priorities of the business community and a public desire to limit future flows of unauthorized migrants. </p>\n<p id=\"PAuVbL\">Most leading Republicans got off that bus years ago in the face of backlash from the grassroots base. But they largely continued to think of the issue in the terms defined by the CIR concept — an economics-heavy worldview that frontloaded questions about impacts on business and the labor market. </p>\n<p id=\"oQX4YK\">Trump likes to say that no one was talking about immigration before he entered the race. That isn't true. But the <em>way </em>he talked about it resonated much more deeply than anything his rivals could muster.</p>\n<aside id=\"cPLeBb\"></aside><h3 id=\"sZSC7k\">Trump made immigration exciting to conservatives</h3>\n<p id=\"JK7Xtq\">Americans' <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9060427/nativism-research-immigration-trump\">feelings about immigration are tricky</a>: Some people are categorically anti-immigrant, others care a great deal about the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and a large share judge immigrants on how close they are to an imagined \"traditional American culture.\"</p>\n<p id=\"GEvSor\">Before Trump, Republicans talked about immigration in terms of policy. They found messages that were <em>acceptable </em>to their conservative base, but struggled to find messages that <em>excite </em>them.</p>\n<p id=\"TeROrV\">Trump’s political success, to the extent that it’s existed, is grounded in finding a language that speaks about the immigration issue in a way that resonates with what people who are worried about immigration actually worry about. </p>\n<div id=\"v9g3CO\">\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Donald Trump Ad|5898\" data-volume-uuid=\"af0b7f314\" data-volume-id=\"5898\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" id=\"volume-placement-957\" class=\"volume-video\"></div>\n\n</div>\n<p id=\"Toe55W\">To understand how that works, it’s useful to examine the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9060427/nativism-research-immigration-trump\">experimental social science</a> that reveals how Americans really feel about immigration. In one important type of study, for example, researchers mix together different hypothetical immigrant traits — a legal Mexican laborer, an unauthorized European student — and ask people the same questions about these hypothetical individuals. That's allowed researchers to disaggregate feelings about immigrants from feelings about whatever ethnic group Americans picture when they think of the word \"immigrant.\"</p>\n<p id=\"2VYqAT\">One key finding of this research is about <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2476001\">12</a><a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2476001\"> percent of Americans are opposed to </a><a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2476001\">any type of </a><a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2476001\">immigration</a>, legal or illegal. Pre-Trump, most GOP politicians drew a sharp distinction founded on legal status. One key exception to that was Sen. Jeff Sessions, who’s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/16/9162905/trump-immigration\">helped Trump write an immigration platform</a> that massively curtails legal immigration.</p>\n<p id=\"nxuf8a\">American University’s Matthew Wright found that another group, about 20 percent of the population, really is focused on illegal immigrants as part of a larger fanaticism about rule-following. Saying that it’s very important to pay parking tickets, for example, is very predictive of harsh views on immigration. </p>\n<p id=\"j0ByPy\">These people likely delight in Trump’s larger “law and order” campaign message and are particularly well-primed to like Trump's message that immigrants are violent criminals: After all, they assume that immigrants here without papers have already demonstrated that they don't respect the law, so what’s to stop them from terrorizing American communities? </p>\n<p id=\"TGwDM6\">A large share of white Americans, Wright finds, doesn’t really care about legal status at all. Their evaluation of immigrants focused on other factors. In his experiment asking whether a given immigrant should stay or go, an unauthorized Christian immigrant fared better than a legal Muslim one. An unauthorized immigrant from France fared better than a legal immigrant from Mexico, but an unauthorized immigrant from Mexico fared better than a legal immigrant from Somalia. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt='\"The Silent Majority Stands With Trump.\"' src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MR7dxZsyguTiZbluswv0z4QxiQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6977229/GettyImages-541748698.jpg\">\n      <cite>Keith Bedford / The Boston Globe via Getty</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"dI8dtF\">People who join Trump in being very alarmed about perfectly legal refugees from Syria but not so worried about <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12377286/melania-trump-illegal-immigrant\">whether Melania Trump had the proper work permits in the 1990s</a> fit into this category.</p>\n<p id=\"dT6Pfr\">Even the non-Trump Republicans who took the harshest line on immigration policy — Rick Santorum and <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration\">(sometimes) Scott Walker</a><strong><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration\"> </a></strong>— addressed it in economic terms: Conservative voters are worried about American jobs. But the thing that Trump stumbled upon is that Americans are less worried about American jobs than they are about American culture, or at least so far as they would define it.</p>\n<p id=\"2u4qix\">Trump has repeatedly accused the government of Mexico (and possibly other countries) of deliberately sending its worst people to immigrate to the United States. That's much closer to the heart of American anxiety. To say that he’s gone beyond even the most hard-core conservatives on this is an understatement. </p>\n<h3 id=\"0fMYg5\">Trump doesn’t have many policies — but he definitely has immigration policies</h3>\n<p id=\"l7AbS3\">Trump has a well-deserved reputation for being a politician who is not particularly invested in white papers and policy specifics. It’s crucial to understand that immigration has been, throughout his campaign, an exception to that rule. His website’s <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions\">issues section</a> lists only seven issues — one of them is Immigration Reform and another is Paying for the Wall.</p>\n<p id=\"SFRuUh\">It’s easy to dismiss the wall, in particular, as meaningless bluster. But Trump really does have a fairly detailed white paper about how he plans to coerce Mexico into <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/pay-for-the-wall\">paying for the construction of a border wall</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"DIN9il\">He also has a detailed and <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/16/9162905/trump-immigration\">specific immigration policy reform agenda</a> that reflects the influence of people who, whether you agree with them or not, are <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/6/11371800/trump-immigration-border-mexico\">certainly well-informed about the details</a>. That starts with Sessions, who’s currently the head of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and who was attacking legal and unauthorized immigration back when most of his party was looking for ways to support comprehensive immigration reform. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Jeff Sessions Donald Trump\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOUhFzm3OG_DRX9zG7v2g0XW1uQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6117085/GettyImages-485195152.0.jpg\">\n      <cite>(Mark Wallheiser/Getty)</cite>\n      <figcaption>Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions onstage with Donald Trump at a 2015 rally in Alabama.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"QeegRn\">At the beginning of this year, a staffer from the senator's office joined Trump's campaign. Sessions is almost certainly the only Washington insider Trump trusts. And Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that his loyalty to people can get in the way of making what other people might consider the best deal.</p>\n<p id=\"a3ymm5\">Let in Sessions, and you let in an established network of people and interests who have been pushing for years for greater border enforcement and a tougher approach to unauthorized immigrants who are already here. </p>\n<p id=\"RwSGhU\">Trump has also received the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council‚ the union representing Border Patrol agents. The union is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, which is hardly a Republican interest group, but it has been vocally opposed to the Obama administration's immigration policy, which it feels ties agents' hands and keeps them from enforcing the law against unauthorized immigrants. </p>\n<h3 id=\"xZhjby\">Trump wants to make life so difficult for unauthorized immigrants they'd leave on their own</h3>\n<p id=\"2kk1k8\">Trump’s official immigration plan would triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the interior of the US, and suggests he would give them a much freer hand to track down and deport unauthorized immigrants than the Obama administration has allowed. But with the exception of people caught at the border and those convicted of crimes — both of whom are already \"deportation priorities\" under the Obama administration — his plan says little about deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"A8oBY4\">The Trump administration would, Congress permitting, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/8/11385842/remittances-immigrants-mexico\">confiscate any money sent by unauthorized immigrants back to their relatives. </a>Trump's proposal claims that Mexico got $22 billion in remittances from \"illegal immigrants\" last year; in fact, that's the <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2013/11/15/remittances-to-latin-america-recover-but-not-to-mexico/\">amount of remittances sent to Mexico period</a> — from legal immigrants, unauthorized immigrants, and even Mexican emigrants in countries other than the US (though the last group only sent 2 percent of remittances). This raises the question of how Trump would differentiate between legal and unauthorized immigrants' remittances.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Moneygram booth for sending remittances\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntqFEb6Kzimuh5u-bdjyup5ErA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4203877/359539113_f19aa96bb9_o.jpg\">\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"yl5RlO\">Trump also wants to ban unauthorized immigrants from receiving tax credits, most of which are supposed to assist their US-citizen children. However, he also wants to get around that problem by banning birthright citizenship (presumably by altering the 14th Amendment or getting the Supreme Court to overturn its 1898 decision that codified it), meaning the US-born children of unauthorized immigrants wouldn't be citizens anyway. Like Jeb Bush, he wants to require all employers to use the E-Verify system to check employees' status before hiring them — which, in theory, would make it impossible for unauthorized immigrants to get jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"IfpZ43\">Altering the 14th Amendment is a pretty tall order, but most of the rest of these could be done — though it's not clear how effective they'd be. Proposals to prevent unauthorized immigrants from getting tax credits are pretty routinely brought up in Congress, and would be fairly straightforward to implement. It's not clear how effective E-Verify would be if it were implemented while 8 million people are already working in the US without papers — states that have tried it <a href=\"http://www.nilc.org/document.html?id=328%E2%80%8E\">haven't seen much success with compliance</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"zXvBOS\">It's unclear if attrition through enforcement would work, because it has not been tried at a federal scale before. It would definitely make it much harder to live in the US as an unauthorized immigrant. But there isn't clear evidence suggesting it would make people more likely to leave.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8w5JYb\">Trump would sharply reduce legal immigration — especially high-skilled immigration</h3>\n<p id=\"ASY3QR\">On the campaign trail and at the Republican convention, Trump's objections to immigrants have focused on <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8922783/immigrants-crime-donald-trump\">his view that they're prone to committing crimes</a> — not, as some of his Republican competitors have emphasized, on the taking of American jobs. But his platform focuses heavily on economic concerns as well.</p>\n<p id=\"DnC7eE\">Rhetorically, he focuses on \"low-wage workers\" being brought to the US by greedy employers. But his specific proposals are squarely aimed at the program Sessions has made his committee's biggest target: <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/3/8337077/h1b-visa-cap\">the H1-B visa for \"high-skilled\" immigrant workers</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"neAjy6\">Trump would raise the \"prevailing wage\" that H1-B workers must be paid, to make it less appealing for employers to hire them. And he would require all employers to \"hire American workers first\" before seeking visas for immigrant labor. (Some employers seeking visas have to attest that they've jumped through certain hoops to recruit Americans before petitioning for the visa; it's not clear if Trump wants to make this requirement universal, or implement something stricter.)</p>\n<p id=\"zmltOM\">Perhaps the most radical idea in Trump's proposals to limit legal immigration is something he calls \"immigration moderation\" — a moratorium on giving any green cards to \"foreign workers abroad\" for a period of time, to force American employers to hire unemployed Americans in the US. Trump doesn't specify if he would put a moratorium on <em>all </em>green cards, or just those issued for employment<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"YEkHJi\">If Trump just wants to stop giving people green cards for the purpose of working in the US, that wouldn't be radical at all. It'd just be another minor tweak aimed at high-skilled workers. Very few people living abroad get employment-based green cards right off the bat, and they tend to be exceptionally skilled workers and rich investors.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Real estate EB-5 recruiters China\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yTOPJt7kzsG0uk4dATUhORNGek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2341044/491150377.0.jpg\">\n      <figcaption>A convention in China where US firms seek to recruit investors among Chinese citizens hoping for green cards.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"o7YGko\">But if Trump is calling for a moratorium on <em>all</em> new green cards, thus preventing <em>anyone </em>from immigrating to the US as a permanent resident, he'd essentially put a freeze on family-based immigration to the US. That would definitely stifle the most common way that \"low-wage,\" low-skilled immigrants come into the country. It would put a huge dent in immigration from Mexico and the Philippines, as well as China and India — all countries where backlogs for green cards are so long that relatives have to wait years or decades before getting them. And it would basically stop the only line that exists for millions of people to get into the United States legally.</p>\n<p id=\"JRRipy\">That would almost certainly increase unauthorized immigration at least somewhat. Not all immigrants would necessarily decide to come illegally instead — to scale the border wall, brave mandatory detention, and risk getting caught at any time by an ICE agent or E-Verify. But some of them would likely feel they had no other choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kg2vzm\">Trump’s latest idea: “extreme vetting” and ideological tests</h3>\n<p id=\"Bv0IQD\">Over time, Trump has only increased the range and depth of his immigration policy proposals — sharpening his bluntest ideas so that they could more easily pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"pqnfFf\">The most recent update came in an ostensibly security-focused mid-August speech that proposed both <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/16/12491000/trump-extreme-vetting-test-immigrant\">“extreme vetting” of would-be entrants to the United States, and a new series of ideological tests</a> to weed out undesirable migrants. </p>\n<p id=\"1DWTXI\">These are different ideas, but rhetorically he did his best to blur the difference between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"hc2pBa\">What Trump actually proposed, according to his speech text, was this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"YvbiM4\">Additional security screening (Trump called it “extreme vetting”) for <em>anyone seeking to enter the US — </em>permanently or temporarily, short-term or long-term, immigrant, tourist, or student.</li>\n<li id=\"0Ngheg\">An “ideological screening test” for people who wanted to <em>immigrate permanently </em>to the United States.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"x2wiTs\">On the face of it, the first of these is a national-security policy: It’s supposed to prevent people from entering the US to do it harm. The second is an immigration policy: It’s supposed to ensure, just as centuries of immigration policy have ensured, that only “suitable” people enter the US.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuMY1a3rWh8-G-xAeLfV7nJAg4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6946213/GettyImages-497722890.jpg\">\n      <cite>Justin Sullivan/Getty</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"0TYZOI\">But Trump could barely talk about one without talking about the other. He emphasized that he was concerned with attitudes “beyond terrorism,” while also expressing concern with the “hundreds of thousands” of people the US admitted from the Middle East on temporary visas each year.</p>\n<p id=\"gMT7nS\">According to the text of Trump’s speech, the candidate proposed admitting “only those who we expect to flourish in our country — and to embrace a tolerant American society — should be issued immigrant visas.” But in delivering the speech, Trump said “should be issued visas” — which, since there are 10 million <em>nonimmigrant </em>visas issued every year and only 1 million immigrant visas, casually expands the population who’d be tested by about a factor of 10.</p>\n<p id=\"96sdwo\">This was probably a reflection of the fact that Donald Trump doesn’t understand immigration policy well enough to know that the difference between “visas” and “immigrant visas” is really important. But it was also a way for him to assert that cultural assimilation is a national-security priority: that when people live in the US who don’t share our values, it makes us less safe.</p>\n<p id=\"zBYKL5\">That’s why, when he talked about terrorism, he talked about <a href=\"http:\">“immigrants or the children of immigrants.”</a> That’s why he’s routinely claimed that second- and third-generation Muslim Americans “don’t assimilate.” In the Trumpian worldview, to allow someone who doesn’t agree 100 percent with the American way of life to set foot in the United States is an unforced error.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7UYzpy\">The immigration debate will never be the same</h3>\n<p id=\"V6Rc55\">Regardless of what Trump says about immigration over the next 10 weeks, he is looking likely to lose in November. And if he does, the Republican Party will almost certainly resolve to never again allow itself to be led by a candidate as undisciplined and unprofessional as Trump. Real politicians who understand how to court donors and build coalitions and spin the press have real value. </p>\n<p id=\"AQiMGN\">But the immigration ideas that Trump stumbled upon are politically potent, and won’t vanish even if Trump himself retreats from the political arena.</p>\n<p id=\"4ttc0N\">The issue, as framed by Trump and as fervently embraced by the Republican Party base, isn’t the specific contours of visa programs or exactly what hoops a long-time unauthorized resident of the United States might have to jump through to receive permission to stay. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt='A Trump supporter carries a sign saying \"Build the wall\"' src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LfZYUH8Od1s6WX0xxNR3__G-Fwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6111367/GettyImages-496175378.jpg\">\n      <cite>Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"tHneiI\">Rather, the issue is American identity and American security with threats to the former defined as threats to the latter. Trump’s campaign has proven the potency of this brand of politics in a way that more conventional, more professional politicians have already noticed — see the mainstreaming of anti-refugee politics even while the GOP primary was under way — and will continue to remember in a post-Trump party. The campaign has also served to push the most immigration-sympathetic Republicans out of the party while pulling the most immigration-skeptical Democrats and independents into it with a lasting impact on the balance of power inside both parties. </p>\n<p id=\"f9L7os\">The underlying demographics of the United States are changing in profound ways, and those changes don’t sit well with everybody. For years, those changes were widely discussed in the media but not addressed by the political system. Trump, for better or worse, has articulated fears that research shows have long been present, and it’s worked for him. He may go away, but his key issue won’t. </p>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004d8b568 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12552082/donald-trump-immigration">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x00000004c7efd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 14:50:06 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x0000000386e310 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Donald Trump and immigration, explained">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000004c7cb18 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 14:50:06 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000004d89ee8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x00000004d88bb0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000004d89ee8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="Dara Lind">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x000000037d4aa8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003874788 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12552082/donald-trump-immigration", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000037c69d0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -

This follows — and greatly expands upon — the news that leaked last week that the foundation would <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/18/politics/clinton-foundation-says-it-wont-accept-corporate-or-foreign-donations-if-clinton-wins/\">stop accepting donations from foreign governments and corporations</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"2AfMRb\">That news, which the Clintons clearly hoped would be greeted as welcome by the press, instead played very poorly. After all, conceding that there was something potentially corrupting about Clinton Foundation fundraising while saying it would continue until Election Day sounded more like a Labor Day special on political corruption rather than a move to curtail it. It also naturally raised the question of why corporate money would be viewed as corrupting but donations from rich individuals would not. </p>\n<p id=\"atBY09\">The move to drastically scale back the foundation — and to try to find new homes for its main undertakings — addresses the problems in a much more dramatic way by simply reducing the scale of the fundraising that will be done. Foundation-related problems have been dogging Hillary Clinton for as long as she’s been running for president. (I wrote an op-ed complaining about the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/la-oe-yglesias4oct04-story.html\">Clinton Foundation’s donor disclosure rules</a> way back in October 2007; the foundation eventually adopted more donor transparency at the Obama administration’s insistence as a condition for her serving as secretary of state.)</p>\n<p id=\"RWCzxg\">To an extent, the change is too little, too late to quiet criticism that the foundation raised money from people and nations that had been before the Clinton-era State Department. But to an important extent, the decision to listen to friendly foundation critics such as <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/16/hillary-clinton-needs-to-step-up-and-get-ahead-of-her-family-foundation-scandal.html\">Michael Tomasky</a> and <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/clintons-ethics-problems-worse-than-she-understands.html\">Jonathan Chait</a> and go well beyond what was leaked last week reflects an important evolution in Clinton’s thinking.</p>\n<p id=\"ZcWK3G\">Clinton is learning, it seems, that just because they’re out to get you doesn’t mean you have to act paranoid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"J9WIuZ\">The Clinton Foundation was a kind of modern political machine</h3>\n<p id=\"iMKUCE\">The best way to think about the Clinton Foundation is probably as a 21st-century version of a classic political machine. It provides a mechanism for people who want to help the Clintons to contribute financially to the cause of helping the Clintons. And it provides a mechanism for the Clintons to help themselves by <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/clinton-foundation-sidney-blumenthal-salary-libya-118359\">offering jobs to people in the Clinton circle</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"DnDeQ3\">That the foundation does genuine good in the world in no way detracts from that machine-like quality. </p>\n<p id=\"igftyV\">Any half-decent political machine would, in fact, spend a great deal of time and energy being genuinely useful to people. The choice between an influence-peddling operation and a helping-people operation is ultimately a false one. As Terry Galway’s excellent book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Made-Creation-American-Politics/dp/0871403757\">Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics</a></em><em> </em>argues persuasively, a good machine was not just a mechanism for extraction. To deliver favors, the machine had to deliver votes, and to deliver votes, the machine had to deliver real services to real people.  </p>\n<p id=\"A7CA3Q\">But if you want to defend the operation on machine terms, then you would need to actually mount the defense. The Clintons’ grudging, day-late, dollar-short concessions to the viewpoint that the foundation is an unacceptable conflict of interest prevent them from mounting a coherent argument in its favor while <em>also</em> failing to conform to modern ideas about proper political conduct.</p>\n<h3 id=\"UdIMeN\">The foundation exemplified the Clinton scandal cycle</h3>\n<p id=\"RAj4NG\">Ultimately, the Clinton Foundation has long been an exemplar of the unhealthy <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/5/12097900/hillary-clinton-scandal-email-cycle\">Clinton scandal cycle</a>. </p>\n<ul id=\"pVNa2K\">\n<li>Consider <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11761128/vince-foster\">the case of Vince Foster</a>: A longtime friend and mentor of Hillary’s came to Washington, had a hard time largely due to the bad-faith machinations of Clinton’s partisan enemies, and killed himself in despair. The upshot was years of entirely baseless charges that Clinton or her husband had him killed. Charges that were repeatedly discredited by a range of official investigators nonetheless kept surfacing, not just in hardcore conservative media but even places like the<em> New York Times Book Review.</em>\n</li>\n<li>When Bill and Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/13/8397309/hillary-clinton-whitewater\">lost money on a bad real estate deal</a> that a friend who turned out to be a con artist suckered them into, it triggered a federal investigation, culminating in Bill Clinton’s impeachment for completely unrelated conduct. </li>\n<li>When they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_travel_office_controversy\">tried to clean up a White House office</a> that the FBI was investigating for financial improprieties, the independent counsel wound up looking into <em>their </em>actions rather than those of the travel office.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"Skxj16\">This appears to have produced in both Clintons a mentality that essentially no matter what they do they will be criticized unfairly for it, and that therefore they have no reason to worry about any kind of appearance of impropriety under any circumstances. When their hand is forced by external circumstances — as when Barack Obama insisted on donor disclosure as a condition of Hillary serving as secretary of state — they will bend. But they fundamentally think the press will hang them regardless of the details of their conduct, so they may as well do what they like. </p>\n<p id=\"DUB2ZN\">In the particular case of the 2016 campaign, they likely feel unusually licensed to do as they please with the foundation because the election is fundamentally a zero-sum game. As Clinton campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon argues, nobody could rationally prefer Trump to Clinton on the basis of the financial conflicts of interest.</p>\n<div id=\"2DB2Sn\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump's businesses exist to enrich himself, involve a web of shady connections, &amp; still he hasn't committed to divesting his holdings (2/2)</p>— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/767717662025801728\">August 22, 2016</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"qo0AqP\">From sufficiently inside the bubble, the fact that anyone is nitpicking the foundation while Donald Trump’s much more flagrant lack of financial disclosure is still out there confirms the sense that the complaining is just bias. </p>\n<h3 id=\"JvYcnM\">Clinton is (maybe) learning to draw a distinction</h3>\n<p id=\"KA3tkI\">This is an understandable worldview on Clinton’s part, but it’s not correct. </p>\n<p id=\"AyJyZc\">Both politics and the media have changed a lot since the 1990s, and Clinton’s tendency to shut out any kind of ethics criticism had long since become counterproductive. The perception that Obama was a cleaner, less scandal-ridden politician helped him defeat her in a 2008 primary facing an electorate that was not at all composed of die-hard right-wing Clinton haters brainwashed by Matt Drudge and Fox News.</p>\n<p id=\"JmPQC2\">Similar concerns boosted Bernie Sanders’s 2016 primary campaign, and though Clinton beat him she’s been struggling somewhat to secure the loyalty of his supporters in the general election. At the Democratic National Convention and just before, she acted to shore up Sanders’s fans by tacking left on a number of key domestic issues, but that’s left behind a good-government cohort. </p>\n<p id=\"9JqXFW\"><a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/clintons-ethics-problems-worse-than-she-understands.html\">As Chait points out</a>, “Voters who supported Sanders in the primary, but who have not embraced Clinton, are <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/how-can-hillary-clinton-win-the-bernie-vote.html\">actually less liberal on the whole</a> than Clinton’s supporters,” but he agreed with some of the criticisms of her paid speaking career and fundraising. </p>\n<p id=\"oqbQAz\">Beyond that, an even broader cohort of liberals are simply frustrated that many goals they hold dear — like beating Donald Trump or raising the minimum wage — were now being held de facto hostage to the Clinton family’s questionable political judgment.

Officials said he was armed with a reportedly stolen handgun — although whether he actually aimed the firearm or shot it at officers remains unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"BS1CcS\">The reports led to hundreds of protesters gathering in parts of the city. The protests escalated into violence and riots on August 13, leading to the destruction of several businesses and vehicles, including police cars. Protests remained tense and sometimes violent on the night of August 14, although there was no widespread property damage on the second day of demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"EMk1Pw\">Even before we knew much about the police shooting, including Smith’s identity and race, it was protested by Black Lives Matter activists as just another example of the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism\">racial inequities</a> in the criminal justice system — an issue that rose to the national spotlight after the police shooting of <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-ferguson-MO-protests\">Michael Brown</a> in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014. The anger behind these disparities, along with longstanding racial tensions in Milwaukee, apparently fueled the riots.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gri2hs\">Police shooting of&nbsp;Sylville Smith: what we know</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Violence and riots erupt in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, after police shooting.\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50h2zH12nqLeNFC6uktVa5Z6wm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6936943/GettyImages-589477500.jpg\">\n      <cite>Bilgin Sasmaz/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"boG08h\">At the time of the August 13 violence, we didn’t know much about the shooting. Soon after, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2016/08/14/man-shot-milwaukee-police-subject-witness-intimidation-case/88721094/\">learned</a> Smith's name and background from police sources and family.</p>\n<p id=\"8HIO4Z\">Police stopped&nbsp;a car with two suspects, including Smith, in the afternoon of August 13. Smith, who allegedly had a stolen handgun, took off running. Police said they told him to drop the gun multiple times before they opened fire, killing him. It’s not clear if Smith pointed the gun or shot at the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"pcA5LM\">The second suspect is in police custody. The reason for the stop is unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"QTeXYc\">The officer who shot and killed Smith had a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6113045/police-worn-body-cameras-explained\">body camera</a> on him. The video will be used as evidence in an investigation carried out by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. But it won't be released to the public until after the investigation is over,&nbsp;<span>Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel </span><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/body-cam-video-milwaukee-shooting-victim-won-t-be-released-n635886?cid=sm_tw\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>Releasing the video earlier&nbsp;\"would compromise the integrity of the investigation,\" Schimel said. \"It is sometimes necessary to confront witnesses with information they didn't know or they didn't know we know. I cannot have witness statements colored or tainted by what they are seeing from other sources.\"</p>\n\n<p id=\"4TmG9U\">The officer is on administrative duty during the investigation. He is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fox6now.com/2016/08/14/chief-flynn-officer-who-fatally-shot-sylville-smith-is-african-american-there-are-concerns-for-his-safety/\" target=\"_blank\">a 24-year-old black man</a> with six years of service — three as an officer — in the Milwaukee Police Department.&nbsp;Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn did not identify him out of fears for his safety.</p>\n<p>Smith's mother, Mildred Haynes,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2016/08/14/man-shot-milwaukee-police-subject-witness-intimidation-case/88721094/\">told</a> the Journal Sentinel that he obtained a concealed-carry license because he was previously shot twice and robbed four times. She said she could not envision him brandishing a weapon at the police, but could see him trying to run and hide.</p>\n<p>Police said Smith had a \"lengthy arrest record.\" The Journal Sentinel also&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2016/08/14/man-shot-milwaukee-police-subject-witness-intimidation-case/88721094/\">reported</a> that Smith was charged in 2015 in a shooting and then charged again for trying to intimidate a witness in that same shooting — but both charges were dismissed. Despite his arrest history, Smith does not seem to have a felony record; he has one misdemeanor conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p>But Smith’s previous convictions aren't what's relevant to the shooting; it's whether he was holding and trying to use his gun on the officers at the time he was shot. The legal standard for use of force requires officers to reasonably perceive a threat at the moment of use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"FBghXB\">So far, we only know what police have said about the shooting. For many Black Lives Matter activists, this is as good as knowing nothing. Trust in the police is fairly low in black communities to begin with. But over the past few years, several police accounts of shootings or killings have also fallen apart <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/10/9886504/police-shooting-video-confidence\">when interrogated with video evidence</a> — making it especially hard for activists and protesters to take cops at their word.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bVGnXW\">Milwaukee's riots and protests began in response to the shooting — and much more</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"The aftermath of riots in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, after a police shooting.\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RVoKjRIUd3o-uI4Kufx_kFu1nEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6936945/GettyImages-589473746.jpg\">\n      <cite>Bilgin Sasmaz/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"tr8sCv\">As news of the shooting broke out,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/violence-erupts-milwaukee-police-fatally-shoot-man/story?id=41368742\">at least 200 people gathered</a> — apparently organizing through social media — in demonstrations. Those protests then quickly escalated, breaking into riots.</p>\n<p id=\"yoZOmh\">According to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2016/08/13/report-1-dead-officer-involved-shooting/88689152/\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> and&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/violence-erupts-milwaukee-police-fatally-shoot-man/story?id=41368742\">ABC News</a>, people set fire to six businesses. They fired off gunshots. They smashed and burned police cars. They threw things, including bricks, at police. And they at one point turned on reporters: \"One reporter was shoved to the ground and punched,\" the Journal Sentinel reported.</p>\n<p>Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/violence-erupts-milwaukee-police-fatally-shoot-man/story?id=41368742\">said</a> 17 people were arrested during the first night of protests, all of whom had criminal records.</p>\n\n<p id=\"WiPRih\">In light of the violence, the mayor pleaded with people to go home. \"If you love your son, if you love your daughter, text them, call them, pull them by the ears and get them home,\" Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said. \"Get them home right now before more damage is done.\"</p>\n<p id=\"jZSO0W\">But protests continued on until the night of August 14. Although there was no widespread property damage like on the night of August 13, there were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2016/08/14/2cabb65a-626d-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> of objects — rocks and bricks — thrown at police and gunshots, which apparently forced police to use an armored vehicle to evacuate an injured man.</p>\n<p>The tensions continued even after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/AP/status/764883542966927361\" target=\"_blank\">activated</a> the National Guard to help keep the peace after the first night of protests.</p>\n<p>City Alderman Khalif Rainey said the area of the riots and demonstrations had become a \"powder keg\" this summer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"MYpvQ7\">This entire community has sat back and witnessed how Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has become the worst place to live for African Americans in the entire country. Now this is a warning cry. Where do we go from here? Where do we go as a community from here?</p>\n<p id=\"ZuhVVW\">Do we continue — continue with the inequities, the injustice, the unemployment, the under-education, that creates these byproducts that we see this evening? … The black people of Milwaukee are tired. They’re tired of living under this oppression. This is their existence. This is their life. This is the life of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"6SZEL9\">Now what has happened tonight may have not been right; I’m not justifying that. But no one can deny the fact that there’s problems, racial problems, here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that have to be closely, not examined, but rectified. Rectify this immediately. Because if you don’t, this vision of downtown, all of that, you’re one day away. You’re one day away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"F6JaVg\">Historians <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8518681/protests-riots-work\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> these types of violent outbursts are typically rooted in longstanding anger toward a system that has in many ways failed them. \"People participate in this type of event for a real reason,\" Darnell Hunt, a UCLA professor who's studied the 1992 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, told me during the Baltimore riots after <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/freddie-gray-baltimore-riots-police-violence\">Freddie Gray</a> died in police custody. \"It's not just people taking advantage. It's not just anger and frustration at the immediate or proximate cause.

This is the context of all the rage behind the protests and riots.</p>\n<p id=\"SUOAY9\">An analysis of the available <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6051043/how-many-people-killed-police-statistics-homicide-official-black\">FBI data</a> by <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6051043/how-many-people-killed-police-statistics-homicide-official-black\">Vox’s Dara Lind</a> shows that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: They accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete, since it’s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force.</p>\n<p id=\"rye0NF\">Black teens were 21 times as likely as white teens to be shot and killed by police between 2010 and 2012, according to <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white\">a ProPublica analysis</a> of the FBI data. ProPublica’s Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones, and Eric Sagara reported: \"One way of appreciating that stark disparity, ProPublica’s analysis shows, is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk. The number is jarring — 185, more than one per week.\"</p>\n<p id=\"Eobujz\">There have been several high-profile police killings since 2014 involving black suspects. In Baltimore, six police officers were indicted for the death of <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/freddie-gray-baltimore-riots-police-violence\">Freddie Gray</a> while in police custody. In North Charleston, South Carolina, Michael Slager was charged with murder and fired from the police department after shooting <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8368197/walter-scott-police-shooting\">Walter Scott</a>, who was fleeing and unarmed at the time. In Ferguson, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-police-officer-darren-wilson\">Darren Wilson</a> killed unarmed 18-year-old <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-ferguson-MO-protests\">Michael Brown</a>. In New York City, NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo killed <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/12/3/7327745/eric-garner-grand-jury-decision\">Eric Garner</a> by putting the unarmed 43-year-old black man in a chokehold.</p>\n\n<p id=\"83XNUP\">One possible explanation for the racial disparities: Police tend to patrol high-crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black. That means they're going to be generally more likely to initiate a policing action, from <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/5/12364580/police-overcriminalization-net-widening\">traffic stops</a> to more serious arrests, against a black person who lives in these areas. And all of these policing actions carry a chance, however small, to escalate into a violent confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"EonML3\">That's not to say that higher crime rates in black communities explain the entire racial disparity in police shootings. <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0141854\">A 2015 study</a> by researcher Cody Ross found, \"There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.\" That suggests something else — such as, potentially,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6051971/police-implicit-bias-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri\">racial bias</a> — is going on.</p>\n<p id=\"KPz9V0\">One reason to believe racial bias is a factor: <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6051971/police-implicit-bias-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri\">Studies</a> show that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in <a href=\"http://www.csun.edu/~dma/FPST/consent.html\">video game simulations</a>. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado, Boulder, psychology professor who conducted the research, said it’s possible the bias could lead to even more skewed outcomes in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" he said, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\"</p>\n<p id=\"1Df48e\">Part of the solution to potential bias is <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6051971/police-implicit-bias-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri\">better training</a> that helps cops acknowledge and deal with their potential subconscious prejudices. But critics also <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/21/9188729/police-black-lives-matter-campaign-zero\">argue</a> that more accountability could help deter future brutality or excessive use of force, since it would make it clear that there are consequences to the misuse and abuse of police powers. Yet right now, lax legal standards make it difficult to legally punish individual police officers for use of force, even when it might be excessive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7zIidE\">Police only have to reasonably perceive a threat to justify shooting</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A police officer at a shooting range.\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLchEWeLdFQG7FbKZzgBX-IZe6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3537446/459617770.0.jpg\">\n      <cite><p>Jewel Samad/AFP via Getty Images</p></cite>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"HtTbAR\">Legally, what most matters in police shootings is whether police officers reasonably believed that their lives were in immediate danger, not whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat. So in the Milwaukee case, the question is whether the officers involved thought he reasonably posed an immediate threat to them or others — so if he actually brandished the gun or otherwise threatened them or others.</p>\n<p id=\"hNuq1q\">In the 1980s, a pair of Supreme Court decisions — <em><a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=471&amp;invol=1\">Tennessee v. Garner</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/386/case.html\">Graham v. Connor</a></em> — set up a framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"h3HwOe\">Constitutionally, \"police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances,\" David Klinger, a University of Missouri St. Louis professor who studies use of force, told <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5994305/michael-brown-case-investigation-legal-police-kill-force-murder\">Vox’s Lind</a>. The first circumstance is \"to protect their life or the life of another innocent party\" — what departments call the \"defense-of-life\" standard. The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping, but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others.</p>\n<p id=\"g3SjvQ\">The logic behind the second circumstance, Klinger said, comes from a Supreme Court decision called <em>Tennessee v. Garner</em>. That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary. (He’d stolen $10 and a purse from a house.) The court ruled that cops couldn’t shoot every felon who tried to escape. But, as Klinger said, \"they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence, and if you’ve got a violent person who’s fleeing, you can shoot them to stop their flight.\"</p>\n\n<p id=\"Fp13qu\">The key to both of the legal standards — defense of life and fleeing a violent felony — is that it doesn’t matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used. Instead, what matters is the officer’s \"objectively reasonable\" belief that there is a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"Ven1du\">That standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides use-of-force decisions: <em>Graham v. Connor</em>. This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who’d survived his encounter with police officers, but who’d been treated roughly, had his face shoved into the hood of a car, and broken his foot — all while he was suffering a diabetic attack.</p>\n<p id=\"DOUzJf\">The court didn’t rule on whether the officers’ treatment of him had been justified, but it did say that the officers couldn’t justify their conduct just based on whether their intentions were good. They had to demonstrate that their actions were \"objectively reasonable,\" given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do.</p>\n<p id=\"eWHc6n\">What’s \"objectively reasonable\" changes as the circumstances change. \"One can’t just say, 'Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago, that means I can use deadly force again now,\" Walter Katz, a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies, said.</p>\n<p id=\"wezVH5\">In general, officers are given lot of legal latitude to use force without fear of punishment. The intention behind these legal standards is to give police officers leeway to make split-second decisions to protect themselves and bystanders. And although critics argue that these legal standards give law enforcement a license to kill innocent or unarmed people, police officers say they are essential to their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"jCy7IH\">For some critics, the question isn’t what’s legally justified but rather what’s preventable. \"We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable. Most are preventable,\" Ronald Davis, a former police chief who heads the Justice Department’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, told the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fatal-police-shootings-in-2015-approaching-400-nationwide/2015/05/30/d322256a-058e-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html?postshare=6361433092045009\">Washington Post</a>. Police \"need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences, and landing on top of someone with a gun,\" he added. \"When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"Ec17yz\">Police rarely get prosecuted for shootings</h3>\n<div id=\"cLnnvC\">\n\n<div class=\"volume-video\" id=\"volume-placement-986\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-id=\"415\" data-volume-uuid=\"d0754ddc5\" data-analytics-label=\"Why police are so rarely prosecuted|415\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-viewport=\"video\"></div>\n\n</div>\n<p id=\"rZ9fbg\">Police are <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8369769/police-shooting-charges-convictions\">very rarely prosecuted for shootings</a> — and not just because the law allows them wide latitude to use force on the job. Sometimes the investigations fall onto the same police department the officer is from, which creates major conflicts of interest. Other times the only available evidence comes from eyewitnesses, who may not be as trustworthy in the public eye as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"o8Ss9Q\">\"There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,\" <a href=\"http://www.krlawphila.com/firm-attorneys/david-rudovsky/\">David Rudovsky</a>, a civil rights lawyer who co-wrote <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Police-Misconduct-Litigation-Michael-Avery/dp/0836610997\"><em>Prosecuting Misconduct: Law and Litigation</em></a>, told <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7173695/ferguson-police-officer-prosecution\">Amanda Taub for Vox</a>. \"And when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite.

The <a href=\"http://www.policemisconduct.net/2010-npmsrp-police-misconduct-statistical-report/#_Prosecuting_Police_Misconduct\">National Police Misconduct Reporting Project</a> analyzed 3,238 criminal cases against police officers from April 2009 through December 2010. They found that only 33 percent were convicted, and only 36 percent of officers who were convicted ended up serving prison sentences. Both of those are about half the rate at which members of the public are convicted or incarcerated.</p>\n<div id=\"VLGiR1\">\n<div data-autotune-alt-embed-url=\"https://apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-police-conviction-incarceration-rates/screenshots/screenshot_s@2.png\" data-autotune-alt-embed-type=\"image\" id=\"vox-police-conviction-incarceration-rates__graphic\" data-analytics-label=\"vox-police-conviction-incarceration-rates:390\" data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\n (function() { var l = function() { new pym.Parent( 'vox-police-conviction-incarceration-rates__graphic', 'https://apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-police-conviction-incarceration-rates/'); }; if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') { var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0], s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/0.4.5/pym.js'; s.onload = l; h.appendChild(s); } else { l(); } })();\n// --></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"article-body\">The statistics suggest that it would be a truly rare situation if the Milwaukee officer was convicted of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"xUUh4s\">But this is essentially the context behind the violence and riots: Police shot and killed someone.

But the legislation also expanded on a section of the Virginia Constitution that remains in place today: the total disenfranchisement of people with felony records.</p>\n<p id=\"fuyGiC\">Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) is trying to change that. In a move that briefly reached the courts, McAuliffe is trying to restore voting rights to 200,000 felons, who are permanently barred from voting under state law. And he tried to do it without the legislature’s approval, by using his pardon and clemency powers to sign an executive order that gave all felons who had served their prison, parole, and probation time the ability to register to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"ArJqAC\">The move, like most things in America, has led to a tense political and legal battle between Democrats and Republicans. But while the particulars of Virginia’s case could have an important impact — Virginia is, typically, an important swing state in elections — this is about an issue much bigger than just one state.</p>\n<p id=\"yNHotL\">In the US, it is actually the norm that people with criminal records lose their right to vote, at least while they are still in prison, on parole, or on probation. This can have a tremendous impact on elections, particularly since black Americans — who are more likely to vote Democrat — are disproportionately likely to be incarcerated. What’s more, this is only one example of what are known as the “collateral consequences” of <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8913297/mass-incarceration-maps-charts\">mass incarceration</a>, which often punishes ex-prisoners for life even after they serve their sentences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9JNnF8\">Virginia’s governor and Republicans are fighting over the voting rights of felons</h3>\n<div id=\"58b9wT\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Virginia Gov.

In his defense, the governor cited the outright racist origins of the law and its disproportionate impact on black voters — about 45 percent of those affected by his planned order are African American, according to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/us/governor-terry-mcauliffe-virginia-voting-rights-convicted-felons.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=A25194D2D4EEAF0218E3660F12C56503&amp;gwt=pay&amp;_r=0\">his office</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"yoKlE5\">But after McAuliffe <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/22/11487912/virginia-voting-felons-prison\">announced</a> an executive order in April that sought to immediately restore voting rights for 200,000 felons, Republicans quickly protested, taking the issue to court. </p>\n<p id=\"IS3rO0\">Republicans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-mcauliffe-to-announce-restoration-of-voting-rights-to-13000-felons/2016/08/20/590b43ee-6652-11e6-96c0-37533479f3f5_story.html\">criticized</a> McAuliffe for including violent offenders on top of nonviolent former inmates — including, accidentally, 132 sex offenders still in custody and a few convicted murderers still on probation in other states. They also called the executive order politically motivated, arguing that the felons unable to vote are more likely to vote Democrat in the upcoming election.</p>\n<p id=\"yRhSJ0\">The Virginia Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/22/487107922/virginia-court-overturns-order-that-restored-voting-rights-to-felons\">sided</a> with Republicans on a technical basis, arguing that McAuliffe’s order was too sweeping. The governor has authority to issue pardons and clemency to ex–prison inmates on a case by case basis, the court said, but he doesn’t have the power to simply restore everyone’s voting rights without looking at each of their individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"4XXLSE\">Now McAuliffe plans to get around that, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-mcauliffe-to-announce-restoration-of-voting-rights-to-13000-felons/2016/08/20/590b43ee-6652-11e6-96c0-37533479f3f5_story.html\">the Washington Post</a>, by using an autopen to, this week, sign individual orders restoring 13,000 people’s right to vote, and, eventually, the rest of the 200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"Xe0AlR\">Most Virginians support the governor’s order, with a Washington Post poll finding that 61 percent of Virginia adults back the move.

Most states don’t let felons who are in prison, on parole, or on probation vote. And 10 states, including Virginia, stopped at least some felons from voting after they completed their sentences, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/map/state-criminal-re-enfranchisement-laws-map\">American Civil Liberties Union</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"C8CkHL\">As a result, the Sentencing Project <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/felony-disenfranchisement/\">estimated</a> in 2012 that <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/10/5/6906875/state-prisoner-voting-law-felon-disenfranchisement-map-virginia\">more than 5.8 million Americans</a> weren't legally allowed to vote due to their criminal records — more than the population of either Colorado or South Carolina. Several states prohibited 6 percent to 11 percent of their electorate from voting.</p>\n<p id=\"y7pown\">Since black Americans are much more likely to go to prison, this had a disproportionate impact on the African-American electorate: While the overall disenfranchisement rate didn't break 11 percent for any state in 2012, the black disenfranchisement rate topped 20 percent in Florida, Kentucky, and, notably, Virginia — three of the states with the most restrictive voting laws for felons.</p>\n<div id=\"Bin0cP\">\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"vox-felon-and-prisoner-disenfranchisement-of-the-black-electorate-in-2012-1:3153\" id=\"vox-felon-and-prisoner-disenfranchisement-of-the-black-electorate-in-2012-1__graphic\"></div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (function() { var l = function() { new pym.Parent( 'vox-felon-and-prisoner-disenfranchisement-of-the-black-electorate-in-2012-1__graphic', 'https://apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-felon-and-prisoner-disenfranchisement-of-the-black-electorate-in-2012-1/'); }; if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') { var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0], s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/0.4.5/pym.js'; s.onload = l; h.appendChild(s); } else { l(); } })(); </script> </div>\n<p id=\"1qh6PG\">This kind of disparate disenfranchisement is what McAuliffe was trying to address. But if he really wants to address all of the restrictions felons face <em>after</em> they complete their prison, parole, and probation sentences, he’ll need to go much further.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h6az5f\">Ex-prisoners face other “collateral consequences” — beyond losing their voting rights</h3>\n<div id=\"sq2fA3\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJtYRxH5G2k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"sC2r2G\">Restrictions on voting are an example of the <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/page.cfm?id=143\">“collateral consequences”</a> that people can face after they complete their sentences. But they’re just one example.</p>\n<p id=\"d84qIj\">Another one: It’s legal in most states for employers to ask in job applications about someone’s criminal record, and not hire someone for a prior crime — even something as minor as a marijuana possession offense. But this can make it much more difficult for inmates to reintegrate into society: If they can’t get a job, they’re much more likely to turn to criminal activities to make ends meet. So reformers started <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/11/2/9660282/obama-ban-the-box\">“Ban the Box,”</a> which seeks to stop employers from asking about criminal records in job applications — although they can do criminal background checks later on in the hiring process.</p>\n<p id=\"nPOq9w\">Collateral consequences apply to all sorts of other issues, as well. People who have served out their felony convictions often can’t apply for public housing or Pell Grants. They can’t receive welfare benefits. They frequently can’t serve on juries. These restrictions can make it more difficult for an inmate to stay afloat and find a job, and they signal that society will never accept him — making him much more likely to turn to a life of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"jWdN9v\">In <em><a href=\"http://newjimcrow.com/\">The New Jim Crow</a></em>, a groundbreaking book about <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism\">racial disparities</a> in the criminal justice system, Michelle Alexander pointed to these collateral consequences — and how they disproportionately hurt people of color — as an example of a new form of racist social control:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"0TnGiZ\">Rather than rely on race, we use our criminal justice system to label people of color “criminals” and then engage in all the practices we supposedly left behind. Today it is perfectly legal to discriminate against criminals in nearly all the ways that it was once legal to discriminate against African Americans.

Thrilled because \"girls can't be president\" was one of the first things a little boy ever flung into my face to prove that women were second-class citizens, and jokes about \"not electing a woman president, because she'll get PMS and nuke everybody\" were some of my first warning signs that misogyny was alive and intractable in the American consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"U50FxN\">I'm moved that we actually got here in my lifetime, and I'm glad that it's her: This woman, of all women, has had to fight to earn her place at the table. She deserves this.</p>\n<p id=\"RNHazx\">Terrified, because we've never actually done this before, and as feminists we probably have no idea how it works. The misogyny is going to intensify over the course of this campaign, perhaps over the course of her presidency. ... The question of how to be tough on her, and hold her to her commitments without dehumanizing her, is new.</p>\n<p id=\"0dGHLS\"><strong>Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women (NOW):</strong></p>\n<p id=\"bUcSi1\">My generation was present at the creation of the modern feminist movement. I read Betty Friedan, marched with Gloria Steinem, fought sexism at work, and challenged society’s assumptions that held women back.&nbsp;So of course I feel the tectonic plates of history shifting all around me.</p>\n<p id=\"R84Cpj\">But I'm keenly aware that for the generations that came of age after me, or are coming of age now, like my 25-year-old daughter, this moment validates their self-confidence and sense of possibility in a very different way.&nbsp;They haven't been asking themselves, \"Can a woman be president?\" To millennials, the answer is self-evident:&nbsp;Of course she can.</p>\n<p id=\"Ml2ufe\"><strong>Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"hJe5VN\">My great-grandmother grew up in a time when women didn't have the right to vote — and now the country is ready to vote the first woman into the White House.</p>\n<p id=\"FqmEbQ\"><strong>Teresa Younger, president and CEO of Ms. Foundation for Women:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"BvCjHM\">I always say that growing up in North Dakota, I knew more about farming than feminism. That said, I knew and understood the power of women’s leadership and the power of women to create change in their communities — something that I now witness on a daily basis. As a woman of color in leadership, watching both President Obama and Secretary Clinton change the image of who can run for our country’s highest office means a lot to me.</p>\n<p id=\"1JcQzG\"><strong>Destiny Lopez, co-director of All* Above All Action Fund:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"SXp0Ih\">I'm a woman, a Latina, and a mother. It matters to me that there's a Latina on the Supreme Court — even more so because she upholds the rights and dignity of our community and communities everywhere.

I've just never been that excited about Hillary Clinton personally. I recognize the momentousness of the moment, and yet I don't feel a whole lot.

Her career has been dedicated to&nbsp;austerity, militarism, and repression — all the worst facets of life under neoliberal capitalism, and all of which are&nbsp;horrible for women —&nbsp;and I have tried to spend as much time as possible fighting those things.</p>\n<p id=\"gzntIl\"><strong>Kathleen Geier, writer, contributor to </strong><em><strong>False Choices: The Faux Feminism of Hillary Rodham Clinton:</strong></em></p>\n<p id=\"28Fmeg\">What does Clinton as the first woman president mean to me personally? Very little, I'm afraid. But then I'm dead inside. Seriously, in spite of my many misgivings about Clinton, I expected to be moved by my party's nomination of its first woman presidential candidate. But I'm not. I'm happy that my nieces, two of whom are still in grade school and two who just recently became adults, are coming of age in a country where gender is not necessarily a bar to the highest office in the land. But that's about it; the rest seems anticlimactic.</p>\n<p id=\"xu2eCI\"><strong>Kim Tran, writer, doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"3OR5b0\">At one point in my life, I would have been thrilled Hillary Clinton was the Democratic candidate. When I was younger, I thought feminism was solely and exclusively about \"women’s rights\" and breaking the glass ceiling. And while both of those things remain important, the person I am now knows feminism to be so much more than the ascension of a white woman to the highest position of power in the world. For me, this moment symbolizes the absence of mainstream intersectional feminism in which race, class, sexuality, and ability are present and necessarily discussed.</p>\n<h1 id=\"wL48q0\">On what having Hillary Clinton as president would mean for feminism and politics</h1>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OiY7NaFCoq6CAWSZapKhssJHTew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6859175/vox-share%20(3).png\">\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"qYckXb\"><strong>Teresa Younger:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"ICydrC\">Secretary Clinton’s candidacy is symbolic of how far we have come. Historically our nation has not been inclusive and has silenced the voices of many of its citizens. It’s been almost 100 years since women were granted the right to vote, so this nomination represents a tangible shift in the culture of American politics that has been a long time in the making.</p>\n<p id=\"toXMKs\"><strong>Terry O’Neill:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"tplDQ2\">Lots of politicians call themselves feminist, but Hillary Clinton digs deeper into her character and personal beliefs.&nbsp; Hillary Clinton is a <em>proud feminist</em>, meaning, for example,&nbsp;she recognizes abortion care&nbsp;is health care and women should have full access, including Medicaid and private health insurance coverage. It also means she doesn't apologize for seeking the highest office — she is putting herself out there, unapologetically seeking power because she intends to use the power of the presidency to improve lives. My fondest hope is that not only will girls know that they can grow up to be president, but boys will know they can be followers of women leaders.</p>\n<p id=\"mMMhjQ\"><strong>Imani Gandy:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"6lvI9h\">The election of a white woman to the highest office doesn't say a whole lot about my feminism. I'm far more moved about what Michelle Obama's tenure as first lady says about feminism — about black feminism — her raising black daughters, as she so poignantly pointed out during her convention speech, in a house that was built by slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"x9Wh85\"><strong>Destiny Lopez:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"l22q9Q\">Hillary Clinton is a longtime champion for reproductive rights and justice, and her statements on the campaign trail show she intends to continue this legacy. I’ve been particularly encouraged by her full-throated support for lifting the Hyde Amendment, the federal ban on abortion coverage in the Medicaid health insurance program. Practically, we need to lift this restriction to remove a primary barrier to abortion access for low-income women; symbolically, this move shows her commitment to elevating in the national conversation an issue that&nbsp;disproportionately&nbsp;impacts those so often left out of political dialogue: poor women, women of color, and young women.</p>\n<p id=\"qmFaEG\"><strong>Cecile Richards:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"kbAssP\">Make no mistake:&nbsp;Access to health care and&nbsp;safe, legal abortion are on the line and on the&nbsp;ballot this year — and&nbsp;Hillary Clinton is the most committed nominee to reproductive rights in history.</p>\n<p id=\"KiBObf\"><strong>Kathleen Geier:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"DF0CAg\">Hillary Clinton's true feminist legacy remains to be seen. In any case, it will have little to do with whether she succeeds in shattering the glass ceiling of the presidency. Instead, it will rest on whether she enacts the kinds of feminist public policies that could be game changers for working women.</p>\n<p id=\"6hWNvj\"><strong>Sady Doyle:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"Jz4Fzm\">A lot of people assumed that the first female president would have to be conservative and anti-woman in order to offset her gender and win an election: the Margaret Thatcher model, or, if you prefer, the Palin option. It's a very real sign of progress that we got a liberal Democrat, with a stated record of supporting feminism specifically, into such a powerful position.</p>\n<p id=\"9TXJqB\">That may not be immediately visible, because the thing about huge social sea changes is that by the time they actually pay off, the world has changed to accommodate them: They look \"normal,\" so we can't imagine how weird and radical they would have looked even a few decades ago.</p>\n<p id=\"bxHs2a\">But this isn't a single-shot solution to sexism, nor is Hillary Clinton's feminism representative of all feminisms. I don't know a single Clinton supporter who thinks it is.</p>\n<p id=\"684oS8\"><strong>Liza Featherstone:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"zVDFMq\">The first woman president of the United States is indeed significant. But plenty of other countries have had female heads of state — many have, like Clinton, benefited from marriage or family connections to powerful men — and it’s really not that interesting when you consider the conservatism of her actual politics. I do think criticism of Hillary — and protest of her policies if she becomes president, as I hope she will, since Trump, a racist and nativist demagogue, is worse — can help feminism to mature.</p>\n<h1 id=\"lNnliN\">On how much representation matters, and what its limits are</h1>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JLOP1AnChd-MyIB_ko8kYvQK-zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6858519/kim_twitter.png\">\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"CnFbZc\"><strong>Teresa Younger:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"POosOV\">Representation is critical to achieving true equality and social justice in our country. Women have historically played a significant role in making change happen. When we are a part of the conversation, we bring attention to the issues that are most important to us and our communities. But women are still dramatically underrepresented on the local, state, and national level. While we are roughly 51 percent of our nation’s population, we still have abysmal representation in&nbsp;company boardrooms [and]&nbsp;legislative chambers, and&nbsp;only make up 20 percent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"wkLKXv\"><strong>Imani Gandy:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"jZ14Bo\">Representation absolutely matters. But it's a sticky wicket when you're a black woman. Obama's candidacy felt far more momentous to me than Clinton's. I almost feel better represented by Obama than by Hillary even though when it comes to my main issue — reproductive rights and justice — Hillary is already campaigning to the left of where Obama campaigned in 2008. I just don't feel the connection to Hillary that I feel to the Obamas, although I know there are some black women who do.</p>\n<p id=\"g86pWu\">Representation has its limits to the extent that folks are going to think, \"WELP! We did it! We have a woman candidate!\" and fail to recognize that we need to keep pushing the envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"3dh2p3\"><strong>Kathleen Geier:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"zhAOP9\">So far as the big picture is concerned, Clinton's candidacy changes very little. We've known for some time that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/24/how-much-does-gender-bias-affect-u-s-elections/\">voter bias against female candidates</a> has substantially diminished, and that female candidates do just as well as men. Clinton's ascendancy is the logical outcome of this process, and if Clinton hadn't been the first female presidential nominee, it would have been someone like Elizabeth Warren or Kirsten Gillibrand or (God forbid) Joni Ernst or Nikki Haley.</p>\n<p id=\"dF1fKS\">We were long overdue for a woman president, and I was confident that even if Clinton didn't prevail this year, we were bound to see one within the next 10 to 15 years. Besides, symbolism only gets us so far. What's much more important is the eradication of structural barriers to women's advancement, and historically Clinton has never been a champion of those kinds of transformative policies. To be honest, I would have been far more excited to see the first socialist nominated as president.</p>\n<p id=\"3Oh9rb\"><strong>Kim Tran:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"kQgjQW\">Regardless of your politics, it’s clear that a woman in a position of great power is still very threatening to American society. That’s a thing white liberal feminists and I can agree on. Men are lauded for their roles as fathers and leaders. Look at the widespread adoration of how President Obama interacts with children.</p>\n<p id=\"G05buT\">On the other hand, Clinton is stuck. Focus groups show reminding America that she’s a grandmother seems disingenuous, but she needs to be humanized and made more likable. So she needs to be seen as maternal while also distancing herself from the femininity and weakness associated with that position.</p>\n<p id=\"25nNb9\"><strong>Liza Featherstone:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"jptYaX\">Look, when I was a kid in the ’70s there was a book in my second-grade classroom called <em>Mothers Can Do Anything!</em> It was so corny and ’70s with orangey-yellow illustrations of smiling ladies as astronauts and so forth. The fact that I still remember it is important — obviously representation affects us psychically, affects our aspirations in some ways that we can’t quantify.</p>\n<p id=\"etvX6v\">But there isn’t much evidence that having a female head of state affects the material well-being of women ... universal social programs (free college, socialized health care, child care) — those are the things that really help women achieve something closer to parity with men. Just ask the poor British women who lost their council housing under Margaret Thatcher — I bet they didn’t feel particularly empowered.</p>\n<p id=\"4KUcHM\"><strong>Terry O’Neill:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"gdbmq9\">Hillary's election doesn't mean we are suddenly in a post-patriarchal society. ... I have no doubt that the people who are most uncomfortable with the idea of a woman POTUS are the ones who will proclaim most loudly that sexism no longer exists because of Hillary Clinton's extraordinary achievement. But that is why NOW is here — we will be calling bullshit on that. And here is the good news: The fight for equality goes on, but what’s different is that Hillary Clinton's candidacy is causing more people to see the problem and feel compelled to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"sKus4e\"><strong>Sady Doyle:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"ZchDfb\">My idea of social justice rests heavily on lived experience: If you've been there, you're more qualified and informed to speak about it. Having female leadership, and women in political office specifically, often means having leadership that is more qualified and prepared to push through measures on issues that affect women. We need to have a seat at the table in order to define the conversation and make demands.</p>\n<p id=\"svOrlr\">That said, we all know what Carly Fiorina stood for, and it wasn't women's health. Pure representation is never enough; women are also specifically incentivized, by sexism, to be the \"good woman\" who permits and aids sexist policies and practices.</p>\n<p id=\"cI6PSH\"><strong>Destiny Lopez:</strong></p>\n<p id=\"ECsKEd\">Young people, people of color, immigrants, and women all have something in common: We've never seen real representation of our communities or our priorities in our government. It's past time that the faces of the diverse new American electorate are represented. But representation is not enough. We need the voices, vision, and values of our communities to be reflected in the policies that shape the future of this country as well.</p>\n\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000002c971e0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002dab4c8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/28/12300078/hillary-clinton-woman-president-democratic-nomination-feminists">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x00000002da8890 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002dab4c8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 12:20:00 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000002d88b58 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002dab4c8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="9 prominent feminists on what Hillary Clinton's historic candidacy really means">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000002d9ca90 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002dab4c8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 12:20:00 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000002c8e568 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002dab4c8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x00000002c6b1a8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000002c8e568 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="Emily Crockett">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000002c9b2b8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002dab4c8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/28/12300078/hillary-clinton-woman-president-democratic-nomination-feminists", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002c650c8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -  All">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000004a9a750 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 21:38:40 -0400>, @author=[], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000004aa5d30 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @entry=[...], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[], @xml_stylesheets=[], @feed_type="atom", @feed_subtype="feed", @feed_version="1.0", @version="1.0", @encoding="UTF-8", @standalone=false, @output_encoding=nil>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Content:0x00000002c349f0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002c650c8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type="html", @src=nil, @xml=nil, @content="  \n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olxW8VbwOdqzIkdk6iuHbzVOFlM=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50423583/13745048_316106668724048_1180140140_n.0.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n  <p id=\"TWGGXQ\">In the two and a half months since he was <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/31/11813640/harambe-gorilla-cincinnati-zoo-killed\">tragically killed</a>, Harambe the gorilla has transcended his lowly origins as some random zoo gorilla. In his afterlife, he has become a superhero, a mega-meme, the internet’s gorilla.</p>\n<p id=\"JhBepc\">The \"Harambe\" meme takes myriad forms, including popular sub-memes like over-the-top parody memorials and the popular viral slogan \"dicks out for Harambe.\" It has also been decried for its racist undercurrent, despite the fact that black communities played a part in creating the meme and popularizing its initial spread on social media.</p>\n<p id=\"Geg0KJ\">On Reddit, forums memorializing him, like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Harambe/\">r/Harambe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dicksoutforharambe/\">r/dicksoutforharambe</a>, have gained thousands of readers since Harambe’s death on May 28.  Currently there are online petitions to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Harambe/comments/4we0h3/petition_to_erect_a_harambe_statue_outside_of_the/?ref=search_posts\">erect a White House statue</a> of Harambe, <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nintendo-make-harambe-a-pok%C3%A9mon\">make him a Pokémon</a>, <a href=\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/make-harambe-new-face-50-bill\">put his face on the $50 bill</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/barack-obama-change-cincinnati-to-harambe-city\">change the name of Cincinnati</a> — the Cincinnati Zoo was Harambe’s home until his untimely demise — to \"Harambe City.\" Last week, a Texas-based <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_TX_81616.pdf\">presidential poll</a> indicated Harambe getting 2 percent of the popular vote (with <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9183515/deez-nuts-explained\">last year’s meme, Deez Nuts</a>, one point ahead).

Many have compared the meme to an extended \"dead baby\" joke, though New York magazine <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/07/harambe-forever.html\">dismissed</a> the entire phenomenon as \"fairly standard internet non-sequitur nonsense humor.\"  Many outlets <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/08/15/internet-harambe-wont-die/88426498/\">also hint at</a> the meme’s more offensive sides.</p>\n<p id=\"YYm0Qg\">Above all, everyone seems perplexed by the meme’s longevity.</p>\n<div id=\"2wm0i2\">\n<div data-did=\"7f3a5f84a35853b723c7eaf0e4d0904ab6a272b0\" data-href=\"https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/hFORihGSYCnwZCJGGT2CTQ/148517895168\" class=\"tumblr-post\"><a href=\"http://musichastherighttoparty.tumblr.com/post/148517895168/the-gorilla-could-have-died-and-been-done-with-in\">http://musichastherighttoparty.tumblr.com/post/148517895168/the-gorilla-could-have-died-and-been-done-with-in</a></div>\n<script src=\"https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/post.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"MhfHGw\">It’s easy to boggle at the popularity and persistence of the Harambe meme.

On May 28, an unsupervised 4-year-old child determinedly climbed into the zoo’s gorilla enclosure and fell into the moat. Interpretations of what happened next differ wildly depending on who was telling the story, but Harambe the gorilla proceeded to strut about the child, drag him out of the moat, and stand over him. While zoo officials clearly believed the child was in danger, other onlookers believed Harambe was just as clearly protecting the child.</p>\n<p id=\"L34g6w\">Ultimately, zoo officials shot Harambe, killing him instantly, opting to use real bullets instead of a tranquilizer dart in order to protect the child if Harambe reacted badly to the tranquilizers before the drugs took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"NNypCn\">The internet hysteria over Harambe was initially pretty over the top, resulting in major public criticism of zoo officials for making the decision to kill the gorilla instead of tranquilizing him, and an onslaught of harassment directed toward the child’s mother for her perceived negligence. Media outlets reported <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36420437\">days of protests</a> and candlelight vigils at the Cincinnati Zoo and <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/03/protesters-gather-at-denver-zoo-to-mourn-slain-gorilla-harambe/\">other zoos</a> around the country, while #Justice4Harambe trended online.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ouvRrT\">Harambe was always about more than a single gorilla</h3>\n<p id=\"3TdJld\">Protesters angry about Harambe’s death were upset for a number of reasons. Many believed killing the gorilla was unnecessary, though <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36420730/expert-shooting-harambe-the-gorilla-was-only-decision-at-cincinnati-zoo\">numerous</a> <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/30/jack-hanna-harambe-gorilla-death\">wildlife</a> <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/news/a60152/jane-goodall-interview-harambe-gorilla/\">experts</a> insisted it was the only safe option; still others believed the entire incident spoke to the inherent cruelty of raising wild animals in captivity.</p>\n<p id=\"90GzK4\">Harambe’s death occurred <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/31/11825548/vox-sentences-gorilla-harambe\">the same week</a> in which 1,000 people died attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to immigrate safely into Europe. Given that the gorilla’s death largely overshadowed the conversation about actual human life, backlash to the backlash was <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/31/11818858/harambe-gorilla-michelle-gregg-mob-justice\">swift to follow</a>.

Meanwhile the contrasting outpouring of grief over black celebrities can sometimes seem artificial—much like the grief over Harambe. Here’s a good example of the way these different points of commentary converged through the meme:</p>\n<div id=\"2YUGxb\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"data-instgrm-captioned\" data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\">\n<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n<div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n<div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"><a target=\"_blank\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BGKUAKWwlhC/\">It's going alittle #toofar #michaeljackson #prince #harambe #rip #death #gorilla #la #icon #instagood #instalike #instadaily #instagram #black</a></p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Jeffrey Mathis (@jmathis0316) on <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T17:51:48+00:00\" style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\">Jun 2, 2016 at 10:51am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<script src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"F4xxm2\">The spread of the meme, however, placed it within the hands of communities which politicized it in a different way. As many noted during <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/20/12226070/milo-yiannopoulus-twitter-ban-explained\">the online harassment</a> of <em>Ghostbusters</em> star Leslie Jones, a frequent tactic of racists on social media has been to compare people of color to the gorilla. Harambe jokes fell into the hands of the right-wing internet almost immediately — though not necessarily because of racism. The creator of the QuakeCon Harambe shrine, Tony Oritz, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/08/09/exclusive-interview-creator-harambe-shrine/\">described</a> himself as a Hispanic Trump supporter to conservative site Breitbart, and claimed the gorilla for his side of the spectrum in a tongue-in-cheek interview:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe Harambe would understand that it’s the fear mongering and corruption that liberals and the mass media have been pushing for so long that got him killed. The one thing that would have prevented the tragic loss of Harambe is having a proper wall in place. There’s only one candidate who is supporting tighter border security and a beautiful wall and that’s Donald J. Trump.</p>\n</blockquote>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cueSr0x2xfzVgBfS80CID5MDgU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6950509/13745048_316106668724048_1180140140_n.jpg\">\n      <cite><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJJTrHojdjM/\">Instagram</a></cite>\n  </figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"Kc207H\">Harambe was always a meme waiting to happen</h3>\n<p id=\"fmyCpx\">When he invented the term \"meme\" in his famous 1976 book <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, Richard Dawkins described it as a cultural mode of transmission that works by replication and succeeds through imitation, similar to a gene. Decades of cultural study have been devoted to defining what a \"meme\" actually consists of, but in an age where internet culture and meme or remix culture are practically synonymous, this process of replication and imitation is simply everywhere, as inherent to modern culture as the internet itself.</p>\n<p id=\"SQTgN9\">Memes seem to live and die by the moment, but the most successful memes seem to have a few common elements: above all, humor, and almost always a sense of irony. A successful meme contains an element of genuine fun, but it often also contains an element of social commentary or ironic commentary on social issues.</p>\n<p id=\"GHcYeE\">Let’s take, for example, the brief but awesome <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/02/22/daniel-daniel-white-vans_n_9291022.html\">\"Damn, Daniel!\" meme</a> that swept the internet earlier this year. As an idea, it was extremely innocuous: an inherently hilarious and affectionate video of a kid (Daniel) coming to school and wearing white Vans. As a meme, it contained an ironic embrace of corporate branding: People responded to the meme by simultaneously laughing at the video’s white-Vans-worship while wanting to buy white Vans themselves. Then they extended the commentary by mocking their own wish to buy Vans. The best memes always have multiple layers within layers that contradict and conflict with each other, while ultimately responding to a larger social impetus — in this case, over-hyped commercialism.</p>\n<p id=\"fWBALP\">The parts of internet culture that thrive on this multi-layered interplay coalesced around the Harambe meme. It served as an opportunity to deconstruct the histrionic level of modern media and social media commentary. It favored irreverence and cynicism.</p>\n<p id=\"ceEIl6\">If you were a progressive, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock what you viewed as the hypocritical haranguing of the mainstream while avoiding real issues of social justice; and if you were a conservative, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock liberal hysteria.</p>\n<p id=\"ufbxg8\">If you were the kind of person wanting to use the Harambe meme as an excuse to be offensive and juvenile in the name of whimsical fun, then the Harambe meme was all yours. If you were looking for an actual excuse to be racist, then the Harambe meme provided that as well.</p>\n<p id=\"I0TYH7\">And if you were among the many, many people who were genuinely sad about Harambe’s death, the meme gave you a way to honor his memory — sincerely or otherwise.</p>\n<div id=\"bF3nD3\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Slowly replacing all the pictures in our house with photos of Harambe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/dicksoutforharambe?src=hash\">#dicksoutforharambe</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/eCSygBgzEV\">pic.twitter.com/eCSygBgzEV</a></p>\n— Mike Walton (@mjwalton01) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjwalton01/status/764174098297659392\">August 12, 2016</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"jZ1hyt\">A study in irreverence — and sincerity</h3>\n<p id=\"nzmULe\">According to <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/dicks-out-for-harambe/\">the Daily Dot</a>, the first person to coin the phrase \"dicks out for harambe\" was Twitch user bigdaddyshaq.

What’s fascinating about the Harambe meme is that it simultaneously manages to encompass so many other parts of contemporary societal concerns at once, while still maintaining its primary focus.</p>\n<p id=\"j6TVId\">On Metafilter Tuesday, a group of users <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/161661/Let-memesplain-Harambe\">had a prolonged and earnest conversation</a> about whether they, and the rest of the internet, were memeing Harambe ironically or not. The fact that such a conversation can exist, with such fervent advocates for multiple interpretations of the meme, almost three months after Harambe’s death, makes the Harambe meme somewhat unprecedented. After all, with most other long-term memes, everyone reifying the meme is in on the message. Everyone knows they’re Rick-rolling ironically; everyone knows they’re ice-bucketing sincerely.</p>\n<p id=\"ZDm4Fr\">Harambe, though, is a different kind of meme; it’s Schrödinger’s meme, both ironic and sincere. And while many might feel that continuing to proliferate it on the internet is tantamount to flogging a dead ape, one thing remains true: As long as Harambe the meme survives, so will the memory of Harambe, the fallen gorilla.</p>\n<p><b>Update: </b>The Cincinnati Zoo has spoken out against Harambe's post-life memeification.

But nor does it mean everything; not even close.</span></p>\n<p id=\"FR5W1n\">\"I recognize the momentousness of the moment, and yet I don't feel a whole lot,\" said Imani Gandy, senior legal analyst at Rewire and co-host of the <em>This Week in Blackness Prime </em>podcast. \"The election of a white woman to the highest office doesn't say a whole lot about my feminism. I’m far more moved about what Michelle Obama's tenure as first lady says about feminism — about black feminism — her raising black daughters, as she so poignantly pointed out during her <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/26/12282862/democratic-convention-michelle-obama-speech-hillary-clinton-woman-president\">convention speech</a>, in a house that was built by slaves.\"</p>\n<p id=\"QUHcZc\">Electing a woman president was supposed to be a hallmark moment for the feminist movement, and it still is for many. But some feminists have complicated feelings about Clinton as a feminist figure — and about the idea that electing a woman president would really represent some pinnacle of achievement.</p>\n<p id=\"ISEYbL\">To understand this ambivalence, it helps to understand where Clinton’s feminism started, and where American feminism has gone since then.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FNnOtJ\">Hillary Clinton has become a symbol for second-wave liberal feminism</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Press Conference about the Equal Pay Act\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3X_fcVNVWhYyz2hZU5Iqof4FJ4Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6975271/1316241.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"1Bw6lI\">The most common critique of Clinton from the left is that she’s too much of an institutionalist, too closely tied to a broken system. But the second-wave liberal feminism that shaped Clinton in the 1960s and ’70s was all about getting more women into those traditionally male institutions of power, said Erin O’Brien, the chair of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"8QgzEd\">All-women’s schools like Wellesley College, which Clinton attended, were \"the foundational spaces for a liberal feminism,\" O’Brien said — focused on proving that women could do just as well as men, and empowering individual women to succeed in public life.</p>\n<p id=\"qPWjIv\">And succeed Clinton did. \"Her résumé is as long and expansive as it could be,\" O’Brien said. \"She's had the advantages of that education and liberal feminist outlook.\"</p>\n<p id=\"QRq7dh\">But those advantages also went disproportionately to white women. That’s one reason many black women in particular have ambivalent feelings about Clinton. As Vox’s Victoria Massie <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/28/12317712/hillary-clinton-black-women-history-feminist\">explained</a>, Clinton represents, and directly benefited from, a mainstream feminist movement that has pushed women of color to the side time and again.</p>\n<p id=\"OXG5AO\">\"Hillary Clinton has definitely become a convenient symbol for all of the arguments against liberal feminism, and all of the anxieties that liberal feminism has brought forth,\" O’Brien said.</p>\n<p id=\"D8kHnp\">Despite its failures of inclusion, Clinton’s feminism was radical for its day. That’s where the \"anxieties\" O’Brien mentions come in; mainstream American society just wasn’t prepared for women who flouted traditional gender roles and sought entrance into male-dominated positions of power.</p>\n<p id=\"pbkg2Q\">Clinton would experience that firsthand over and over again, especially as her husband Bill Clinton grew as a public figure: giving up her maiden name in an attempt to please Arkansas voters, making an <a href=\"http://time.com/4054623/clinton-dunham-tea-cookies/\">offhand remark</a> about cookies and tea that sparked major controversy, receiving endless <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12377900/hillary-clinton-sexist-interview-questions\">skeptical questions</a> from television interviewers about whether America was really ready for an \"opinionated\" first lady.</p>\n<p id=\"9e2l4r\">And it got a lot worse than sexist condescension. \"There’s always been a major, pretty awful conspiracy surrounding her for 30 or 40 years,\" O’Brien said, most of which have been totally baseless — from <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11761128/vince-foster\">Vince Foster</a> to <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/10/22/9600322/hillary-clinton-benghazi-hearing\">Benghazi</a>. \"I think the willingness to go for such consistent, not empirically informed, crazy theories has to do, in part, with her gender.\"</p>\n<p id=\"LA8Y1M\">After all, O’Brien said, it’s not new for the progressive reform efforts of feminism to inspire vicious, over-the-top, deeply personal backlash. Just look at the <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/52207/12-cruel-anti-suffragette-cartoons\">propaganda cartoons</a> of suffragettes depicted as ugly, sexless man haters who would cheerfully abandon a crying infant just to go to the polls — and how <a href=\"http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/08/anti-feminists-continued-backlash-suffragettes/\">depressingly similar</a> the imagery of modern sexist stereotypes can be.</p>\n<p id=\"Zj2tQg\">That’s one reason that older feminists, baby boomers in particular, are such strong Hillary supporters: Many of them can personally identify with the types of sexism she has experienced, and they’ve seen her spend 40 years getting disparaged for her gender and succeeding in spite of it.&nbsp;They want future generations to have better role models and higher expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"bcWN4K\">\"My fondest hope is that not only will girls know that they can grow up to be president, but boys will know they can be followers of women leaders,\" said Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MQWMAX\">Today’s feminists are fighting different battles</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"May Day Rally Held in Los Angeles\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQEvn6QqB9WdgBpjdYpplPeeZ6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6975371/471873938.jpg\">\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"SGiKaU\">While the feminism that Clinton came up in was once radical, it seems downright mainstream, and even a little conservative, to many feminists these days.</p>\n<p id=\"ZhuIge\">\"When I was younger, I thought feminism was solely and exclusively about ‘women’s rights’ and breaking the glass ceiling,\" said Kim Tran, a feminist writer and doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley. \"And while both of those things remain important, the person I am now knows feminism to be so much more than the ascension of a white woman to the highest position of power in the world.\"</p>\n<p id=\"7RfHeg\">Tran is an intersectional feminist, someone who takes into account all the different ways that factors like class, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, and physical or mental ability intersect with gender to produce unique challenges for different groups of people — challenges that often get overlooked by politicians and members of the public who don’t share them.</p>\n<p id=\"7pa0EE\">This kind of feminism considers the institutional access model of liberal \"white feminism\" to be sorely lacking. Some marginalized women still face as many barriers to elite institutions as white women used to. Plus, not all women can or want to live their lives pursuing mainstream institutional success — but they should still be able to live lives of basic stability and dignity. Instead of \"having it all,\" too many women worry about not having enough to get by.</p>\n<p id=\"S2kEhB\">\"Hillary Clinton is threading a difficult needle,\" O’Brien said. \"Women who are not feminists, and many men, of her era find her crazy and radical and threatening and all of those things. But then when she's with younger feminists who take the intersectionality critique much more seriously, they find her hopelessly moderate.\"</p>\n<p id=\"gzdzqp\">Many intersectional feminists do care deeply about women’s representation in politics. But for women of color in particular, that representation can get complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"S4LKT3\">\"It’s a sticky wicket when you're a black woman,\" Gandy said. \"I almost feel better represented by Obama than by Hillary, even though when it comes to my main issue — reproductive rights and justice — Hillary is already campaigning to the left of where Obama campaigned in 2008. I just don't feel the connection to Hillary that I feel to the Obamas, although I know there are some black women who do.\"</p>\n<p id=\"zypDa2\">\"Young people, people of color, immigrants, and women all have something in common: We've never seen real representation of our communities or our priorities in our government,\" said Destiny Lopez, co-director of the All Above All Action Fund. \"But representation is not enough. We need the voices, vision, and values of our communities to be reflected in the policies that shape the future of this country as well.\"</p>\n<p id=\"7QfTum\">It’s worth noting that electing a woman president would likely be far more than a symbolic victory. Political science research shows that women <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12266378/electing-women-congress-hillary-clinton\">really do govern differently than men</a>, and push harder for policies that specifically affect women. Other research <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11829852/clinton-woman-effect\">shows</a> that when more women are elected to office, it inspires more women to run for office — and having a woman in the highest office in the land could inspire many, many more women to run.</p>\n<p id=\"w4tvJh\">But for some feminists, especially socialist feminists who focus more on class and economic issues, representation isn’t just \"not enough.\" It’s barely relevant — at least compared with the actual policies that women in government might push for or the oppressive systems that they will (or won’t) work to change.</p>\n<p id=\"0FtZx3\">\"Universal social programs (free college, socialized health care, child care) — those are the things that really help women achieve something closer to parity with men,\" said Liza Featherstone, editor of <em>False Choices: The Faux Feminism of Hillary Rodham Clinton</em>. \"Just ask the poor British women who lost their council housing under Margaret Thatcher — I bet they didn’t feel particularly empowered.\"</p>\n<p id=\"OA2BqO\">\"Hillary Clinton's true feminist legacy remains to be seen,\" said Kathleen Geier, a contributor to <em>False Choices. </em>\"In any case, it will have little to do with whether she succeeds in shattering the glass ceiling of the presidency. Instead, it will rest on whether she enacts the kinds of feminist public policies that could be game changers for working women.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"bRH2Dr\">Clinton’s feminism has evolved, too</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Hillary Clinton Address Trayvon Martin Foundation Conference\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xVWqqPXHo8TTAavw4bHTUo16wwY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6975383/533311892.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Clinton sits with Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"n3J9D0\">Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign is very different from her 2008 campaign. Then, she dramatically downplayed her gender, her feminism, and the potentially historic nature of her candidacy. Now she openly embraces all of those things, and it seems to be working well for her.</p>\n<p id=\"lwJ0P2\">But Clinton’s 2016 campaign isn’t just vocally feminist — it’s also vocally intersectional. Clinton <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/hillary-clinton-intersectionality/472872/\">uses that term often</a>, and in ways that seem on point. She talks about how the gender wage gap is worse for women of color. She’s in favor of allowing federal funds to cover abortion services, because low-income women and women of color are more likely to be insured through public programs like Medicaid and thus have a harder time paying for an abortion. She talks about how the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, isn’t just a public health crisis but a crisis of poverty and racism.</p>\n<p id=\"UCdkjf\">\"Many feminists of color think Clinton is late to the game,\" O’Brien said. \"But she is <em>at </em>the game now. Her feminism wasn’t born of [intersectionality], but she’s a learner.\"</p>\n<p id=\"OzWmDw\">Clinton has improved in addressing issues related to social class and race, O’Brien said. Still, the relative recency of her conversion, and the many years she’s spent presenting and governing like a more conventional white liberal feminist, make some younger feminists wary. Does she really care about these issues, or does she want to win?</p>\n<p id=\"Jz4Fzm\">The answer may be both. Clinton is a savvy politician who can probably tell which way the cultural winds are blowing on these issues with her base. But there was an intersectional flavor to Clinton’s early feminism, too, like the work she did to bust up illegal school <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/us/politics/how-hillary-clinton-went-undercover-to-examine-race-in-education.html?_r=0\">segregation</a> and help <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/speced/2016/07/hillary_clinton_disability_activism.html\">disabled children</a> get equal access to education.</p>\n<p id=\"NDChWY\">Either way, America seems to have evolved on feminism to a certain extent along with Clinton.</p>\n<p id=\"dxVKzp\">\"A lot of people assumed that the first female president would have to be conservative and anti-woman in order to offset her gender and win an election — the Margaret Thatcher model, or, if you prefer, the Palin option,\" Doyle said. \"It's a very real sign of progress that we got a liberal Democrat, with a stated record of supporting feminism specifically, into such a powerful position.\"</p>\n<p id=\"lTB938\">That may not seem remarkable to us now, Doyle said, but \"the thing about huge social sea changes is that by the time they actually pay off, the world has changed to accommodate them.\"</p>\n<p id=\"NUqpeV\">Still, the world has only changed so much. Toxic misogyny is still a serious problem, and <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/16/11683122/donald-trump-misogynist-sexist\">Donald Trump</a>’s campaign is a potent symbol of that. And feminists of all kinds are going to have to figure out how to deal with it as the campaign continues.</p>\n<p id=\"aCyFKs\">\"The misogyny is going to intensify over the course of this campaign, perhaps over the course of her presidency — just as the racism aimed at Barack Obama only intensified over the course of his presidency — and we're obligated to find a way to defuse and defeat it,\" Doyle said. \"But we also have an obligation to hold her to account, just as we do with all other politicians.\"</p>\n<p id=\"C8yqkL\">\"Regardless of your politics, it’s clear that a woman in a position of great power is still very threatening to American society,\" Tran said. \"That’s a thing white liberal feminists and I can agree on.\"</p>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004d89588 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000023510b8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12370784/hillary-clinton-woman-president-feminists-conflicted">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x0000000232fc88 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000023510b8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 12:00:03 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x000000022f5100 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000023510b8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Why some feminists are conflicted about Hillary Clinton's historic candidacy">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x0000000230b770 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000023510b8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 12:00:03 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000004d43e70 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000023510b8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x00000004d42b38 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000004d43e70 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="Emily Crockett">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000004d8a938 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000023510b8 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12370784/hillary-clinton-woman-president-feminists-conflicted", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000004d40c98 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -

Seventeen small dishes arrived filled with battered and fried vegetables, raw and fried cheeses, oily frittatas, salamis, crackers, and breads. There were so many plates, in fact, that the servers brought a side table to accommodate them.</p>\n<p id=\"kNKQGp\">Then came the primi (first course, often pasta) and secondi (second course, usually fish or meat), followed by dolci (dessert, often gelato). In the&nbsp;gelaterias<i>, </i>I noticed something new: Servers were now offering to dip the cones in chocolate, in addition to the usual offering of whipped cream topping (gelato con panna).&nbsp;<br><br>  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"gelato\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwVL5heNYbGk58vhDDsLpmTTmGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6975317/shutterstock_176673377.0.jpg\">\n  </figure>\n</p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Gelato, an Italian tradition, now comes dipped in chocolate and topped in whipping cream. (Paolo Bona/Shutterstock)</p>\n<p id=\"kszWij\">\"The Italians are eating a lot, all the time!\" my boyfriend, who’s from Germany, would exclaim as we watched many courses fly by the tables around us in what became a mini study of contemporary Italian eating habits.</p>\n<p id=\"CAvajb\">We love food, and went to Italy this summer with dreams of handmade pasta, juicy produce, and fresh fish. Instead, we were surprised to find scant vegetables and too many fried, meat- and sugar-filled dishes.</p>\n<p id=\"R9R03f\">This brief immersion in the mythical Mediterranean diet in Southern Italy got us wondering about the country’s changing eating habits and their impacts on public health. And then I started poking around. Here are three things I learned.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rMA39N\">1) Italy’s childhood overweight and obesity rates are among the highest in the world</h3>\n<p id=\"SYesU9\">While there’s no one Mediterranean diet, the typical dietary pattern in Southern Italy has long been <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878450X14000213\">celebrated</a> as one of the <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/nutrition-mediterranean-diet-willett-trichopoulos/\">healthiest</a> in the world, with high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, lean protein (particularly fish), and olive oil, and low consumption of red meat and sugar.</p>\n<p id=\"PsrTp5\">But after eating so many voluminous meals and watching Italians gobble up ice cream at the gelaterias in every town we visited, it was harder and harder to comprehend how they could maintain their slim physiques.</p>\n<p id=\"DYVqiS\">It turns out they’re not: Obesity has increased dramatically in recent years among young Italians. According to the <a href=\"http://easo.org/media-portal/country-spotlight/obesity-in-italy/\">European Association for the Study of Obesity</a>, the adult obesity rate is among the lowest in Europe (about 10 percent of the population), but childhood overweight and obesity rates are among the highest in the world.</p>\n<p id=\"tnJy7w\">You can see how Italy stands out on this 2014 chart from the OECD, showing the overweight prevalence&nbsp;<span>(including obesity)</span><span> in boys under age 18. Italy is </span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756110/so-much-for-the-mediterranean-diet-greece-italy-have-the-worlds-most\">second in the world only to Greece</a><span>:</span></p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UEBf8rzH4hiorrHcYQ47Uuj_BX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6964735/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-19%20at%205.13.56%20PM.png\">\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"MiRxDd\">Italian girls are in about the same situation: 34 percent are overweight or obese.</p>\n<p id=\"B282PA\">Take note — the United States is actually behind Italy when it comes to overweight children. And the reason for Italy’s rise in childhood obesity, researchers say, has to do with food.</p>\n<h3 id=\"EcTFRG\">2) There are growing concerns about the quality of the Italian diet</h3>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">People standing in line at the McDonald's in Milan. (Pier Marco Tacca/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Most Italians today don’t actually follow a \"Mediterranean diet.\" In a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449854\">2015 study</a> of more than 5,000 Italians’ eating habits, fewer than half (43 percent) said they ate Mediterranean-style. The rest were following either a diet that was low in fruit and vegetables or a \"Western-like\" diet, which included more red meat and dairy products like butter instead of olive oil.</p>\n<p id=\"2mc9rQ\">Zachary Nowak, a PhD candidate at Harvard University and associate director for the <a href=\"http://www.umbra.org/academics/food-studies/\">Food &amp; Sustainability Studies Program</a> at the Umbra Institute in Central Italy, says he’s seen some unhealthy changes in recent years. In his 14 years shuttling back and forth between Perugia and the United States to do research, he said he’s observed a trend toward larger portions and more refined carbs like bread, pasta, and sugar, instead of more fruits and vegetables or lean meats and fish.</p>\n<p id=\"km3XKS\">\"Italy has been in a deep recession for way longer than 2009,\" Nowak said. Pasta and sugar are cheaper than fish and vegetables, so he thinks Italians are relying more on the former for their calories.</p>\n<p id=\"0s69kY\">A <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/Newsroom/en/news/2008/1000871/index.html\">report</a> by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization came to a similar conclusion, finding Mediterranean people \"have shunned the Med Diet.\" Between the 1960s and early 2000s, the daily calorie intake in Italy increased by 30 percent. And many of those calories, according to the report, are coming from foods that are  \"too fat, too salty and too sweet.\"</p>\n<p id=\"p1SaoM\">Angelo Pietrobelli, a professor of pediatric nutrition at the Verona University Medical School, also lamented that Italy is grappling with the incursion of the Western diet: more sugary, refined foods, especially soda. Sounding very much like an American health official, he explained in an email that public health in Italy is working to introduce more produce in schools, and remove vending machines.</p>\n<p id=\"RAoO95\">Other outsiders have noticed the changes. In an excerpt in <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2014/01/children_s_eating_habits_in_italy_european_kids_eat_junk_food_too.html\">Slate</a> from her book<em> </em><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807032999/?tag=slatmaga-20\">The Lost Art of Feeding Kids</a></em><em>, </em>author <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/authors.jeannie_marshall.html\">Jeannie Marshall</a> points out that junk food companies like Coca-Cola have been heavily marketing soft drinks to Italians — and making headway. Italians now drink more than <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828681/\">8 gallons</a> (per capita) of soft drinks per year. That’s small compared with the US, which has the highest consumption rate in the world at about 30 gallons, but it’s still a big change. (As Marshall writes of a dinner in Rome,  \"I was surprised when the waiter asked my 6-year-old son, Nico, if he wanted a Coca-Cola with his pizza.\")</p>\n<h3 id=\"V9GCC4\">3) There’s no good data on changing portion sizes — but there are clear signs of a problem</h3>\n<p id=\"HtyA0K\">I could not find any good data on how portion sizes in particular have changed in Italy over the years beyond anecdotes and research that suggests calorie consumption has gone up.</p>\n<p id=\"cg8kRG\">But I did find other evidence that Italians’ plates may be overflowing with food.</p>\n<p id=\"jKIpfa\">Italian legislators recently passed a law to reduce food waste, which included money for rebranding and destigmatizing <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/08/italy-passes-bill-reduce-food-waste\">the doggy bag</a> in restaurants. The goal: to get people to bring food home in order to eat it later instead of throwing it away (or perhaps overeating).  Meanwhile, the Italian celebrity chef Massimo Bottura is <a href=\"http://www.eater.com/2016/8/3/12347258/massimo-bottura-rio\">leading another food waste initiative</a> to educate and feed refugees, the homeless, and the working poor.</p>\n<p id=\"VFS0OR\">All this suggests there’s a lot of extra food being prepared. Sometimes it’s going to waste. Sometimes people are eating too much. Either way, at least Italians are starting to address the problem.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfUfW-hiaxWh8SbQAzapN7FDpF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6965307/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-19%20at%206.23.06%20PM.png\">\n      <cite><a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/italy/Obesity-Update-2014-ITALY.pdf\">OECD</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>Trends in the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) in adults and projections and recent estimates in selected OECD countries.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"U2BdhK\">In a global context, Italy is still in okay shape.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<p><b>Lauren Katz: This project is so unique. What's the idea behind asking people to write letters to younger generations in the future?</b></p>\n<p>Jill Kubit: The main focus right now is on writing letters to our own children, our grandchildren, our nieces and nephews, or other people in our lives that are really young. The purpose is to write them now in order for us to document what we're doing, and how we're thinking about climate change. Those messages are going to be received in the future to our children when they're grown. There's also a photography project, and we're starting to move into videos.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"caption\">(<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deartomorrow.org/#!For-good-reason-Im-about-the-business-of-creating-a-world-where-we-can-all-thrive-love-and-selfdetermine-my-love/c367/5740dca30cf293e8d8d95352\" style=\"font-family: Balto, Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;\">DearTomorrow</a>)</p>\n<p>We think that by getting people to thinking about climate change in the context of someone they actually care deeply about — their own children, their grandchildren, students of theirs, nieces or nephews — it changes the way people think about the issue of climate change. It makes it much more relevant to them.</p>\n<p>The project comes out of my own experience of working in this field, and also becoming a mother. My own thinking about climate has changed because I'm a mother.</p>\n<p><b>LK: How so?</b></p>\n<p>JK: When people talk about climate change, it seems very far away and distant into the future. People talk about making a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and they say something like, \"By the year 2050, we cannot use fossil fuel,\" and the year 2050 as a number still seems like a really far distance. But when you have a child and you start to think about how old they will be in that year ... it changes how I think about time.</p>\n<p><b>LK: That makes a lot of sense. You've also spent 10 years at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations working to engage the US labor movement on climate change. How does the work you've done shape how you approach this project?</b></p>\n<p>JK: My previous work has been thinking about climate change through the lens of the policies that need to be implemented and how that is going to impact people, communities, and workplaces. So I've always had this sense that climate change is not about open fields or preserving the wilderness. It's not about polar bears. It's about how the environmental changes that we're making will impact people.</p>\n<p>I think being a parent makes me personally more motivated to do this work because everything I know about climate change and all the transitions we need to make toward renewable energy, I'm thinking about it in a way that impacts me in a personal way. I have a 3-year-old son, and I'm thinking about what I want his world to look like as he's growing up. I can kind of parallel the transition that's needed with the way I would like his life to develop and unfold.</p>\n<p><b>LK: People can send messages via letters, photos, and videos. And they're not all parents or people with children in their lives – some letters are written to future children. Is there one letter that stands out as particularly moving?</b></p>\n<p>JK: Currently, my favorite letter is written by a woman who is a field organizer and does environmental work in Tennessee. She wrote a beautiful letter to her daughter. She starts from a place of talking about her love of nature, and then she goes on and talks about the threat of climate change.

What's your archiving plan?</b></p>\n<p>JK: The archive is a work in progress. Right now, the plan is to keep the project open [until] 2020. We see this as the most important period of time in engaging people on climate, and it's really important that we start to shift our policies so that we can move toward renewable energy.</p>\n<p>All the letters will be available during this time period. Then the plan is to, at some point, take the letters down and to relaunch them in the year 2030 and 2050. We're currently working with a professional archivist whose job is to transition this data of the period of time. We know the technology is going to change over this period of time. Her job is to figure out how to transition year to year, so we'll have the data available to people in 2030 and 2050.</p>\n<p>We're currently looking for a major institution to partner on the project that would house the long-term collection, so that our own children and future generations would be able to view the letters.</p>\n<p><b>LK: What do you hope the recipients will gain from reading these letters in the future?</b></p>\n<p>JK: I hope that in 2050, when people see the letters, they'll be able to look back on this period of time and see how people thought about climate change and how that thinking changed during this important period of time. We think that could be a very powerful thing, for people to look back and say, \"Wow, there were a lot of people who fought for us to make a transition to renewable energy.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"caption\">Maxime Zucca, France. (Trisha Shrum)</p>\n<p>In my vision of the world, in that period of time people would be able to look back on today and say, \"What was it like to live with fossil fuels? What was it like to live through this massive transformation?\"</p>\n<p>When I think about the conversation I have with my own son in 2050, I don't want say to him, \"I'm sorry, we tried.\" I want him to ask me questions like, \"What role did you play in this transformation? And what did the world look like before?\"</p>\n<div></div>\n<p><b>LK: It's great that you're laying the groundwork for a future history lesson.</b></p>\n<p>JK: I hope the history lesson is a positive one. I have a lot of faith in people, and I have a real sense in the power of individuals and the power of the collective. I believe that people will come together and make this transformation happen. What I love about the project, maybe more than anything, is that I'm constantly struck by how much people care about this issue, and how much emotion comes through their letters. Like me, they're able to connect the love they have for their kids with the passion they have for this issue.</p>\n<p><b>LK: There are plenty of opportunities for motivated people to take action online or volunteer in person. How will contributing to your project have an impact in addressing climate change?</b></p>\n<p>JK: The project is unique because it allows people to reflect on their thinking. We know the project has the potential to get people thinking about climate change on a deeper level.</p>\n<p>It's also an opportunity for people to share what they're doing with their friends and family. The environmental movement sometimes is an echo chamber, but we're not talking about climate change to our friends and family. One of the most powerful parts of the project is when people write in and ask them to share through their social networks. The project provides an opening for people to talk to each other about climate change beyond those who are already committed.</p>\n<p><i> You can send your own DearTomorrow message&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.deartomorrow.org/#!send-a-message/c1cgd\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</i></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Watch: What people get wrong about climate change</h3>\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"What people get wrong about climate change | 5470\" data-volume-uuid=\"4b0f4fb92\" data-volume-id=\"5470\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" id=\"volume-placement-2267\" class=\"volume-video\"><br></div>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000003b4bc68 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000004b330e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/11971352/deartomorrow-climate-change-environment">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x00000004b31768 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000004b330e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 11:20:05 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000004af4c78 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000004b330e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="It's hard to talk about climate change.

Sure, speeches, advertising, and interviews with reporters can sometimes make the difference in local, House, or even Senate and gubernatorial races. But that is because in those elections, the campaigns are often greatly mismatched in resources and political skill.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of evidence that campaign communication has diminishing marginal returns, which makes presidential campaigns different. Going from no advertising to some advertising, an incompetent campaign message to a reasonably plausible one, or no get-out-the-vote operation to a decently organized one makes a really big difference in a candidate's fortunes. But the better a campaign already is, the smaller the effect of making it better.</p>\n<p>Relative to campaigns for lower offices, presidential campaigns are always fairly well funded and competently run on both sides. Sure, some presidential campaigns are better run and have more resources than others. Yet even the worst modern campaign is better run, gets more publicity, and energizes its supporters much more than weak campaigns at lower levels.</p>\n<p>The diminishing marginal returns to these tactics means the difference between the major parties' presidential campaigns has only a small effect on the outcome. Even relatively weak general election presidential campaigns get most of the benefits that they can from campaign tactics, leading the two campaigns' effects to mostly cancel each other out. What influences the outcome more are the things outside of the campaigns' immediate control, such as economic performance, the existence of an unpopular war, or the current president's approval rating.</p>\n<p>Yet as you may have noticed, things are different this year. The Trump campaign is so&nbsp;<a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-camapaign-july-spending-double\" target=\"_blank\">weak</a> that it appears to be affecting the race. Political science models predicting the 2016 election based on various fundamentals (i.e., variables that ignore the two candidates and their campaigns) mostly predict a very close election or a Republican victory. Trump is vastly underperforming these fundamentals. He is currently somewhere between 5 and 10 points behind in&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">polling</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">averages</a>.</p>\n<p>The reason is that his campaign is weaker than any in the modern media era. There is arguably a bigger mismatch relative to the opposing campaign than in any presidential election in American history. The many errors of messaging by Trump and his campaign staff are too numerous to list here.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that he has presented himself in ways that have little appeal beyond the Republican base, some of whom will vote for him because they like his message and others out of partisan loyalty. But many other Americans who would be willing to vote Republican this year are repelled by Trump.</p>\n\n<div></div>\n<p>The strange thing is that this means the details of Trump's campaign tactics matter a lot. Normally, both campaigns are competent enough&nbsp;<span>that they are deep into the diminishing marginal returns for campaign communication. But this year, the Trump campaign has been so weak, I don't think diminishing returns have really kicked in yet. Trump could improve his fortunes a lot if he managed to run a weak but essentially normal presidential campaign.</span></p>\n<p>Usually, political scientists scoff at most of pundits' analyses of campaign ads and speeches. Does this or that message resonate more with the electorate? It all seems more like theater criticism than serious political analysis. Don't pundits know that the only people paying close attention to these subtleties have already made up their minds?</p>\n<p>That is usually true, but not this year. There seem to be a decent number of voters who at this point normally would have been convinced to vote Republican for president but are repelled by Trump. Many of these voters could be persuaded if only Trump could get them to perceive him as a conventional Republican.</p>\n<p>I am skeptical that Trump and his campaign can pull this off. At various times, they have promised a pivot to a message more suited to the general election. But they revert after often only one day or one speech of acting like a conventional Republican. Trump seems incapable of acting different in public for very long, and with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/trump-hires-breitbart-executive-in-campaign-overhaul.html\">hiring</a> of Stephen Bannon from Breitbart as the campaign's new chief executive, his conduct is likely to get more extreme and outlandish. But just because Trump may not be willing to pivot doesn't mean it wouldn't work.</p>\n<p>So as a political scientist, I have to constantly check my instincts when watching speeches and advertisements this year. My reflex is to say they don't matter much. That is still true for Clinton, who has run a fairly normal campaign, but not for Trump.</p>\n<p>When we watch things like Trump's first <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/19/490609443/watch-donald-trump-releases-first-campaign-ad-to-air-in-4-states\">television advertisement</a> or his latest <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/18/politics/trump-i-regret-sometimes-saying-wrong-thing/\">speech</a> attempting to moderate his style (scripted and using a teleprompter!), the details are significant.&nbsp;<span>There are people listening who want to vote Republican. All it takes is a competent campaign and a candidate who appears normal to bring them home. </span></p>\n<p><span>The details of the message matter this time. If the Trump campaign could go from incompetent to just worse than average, it would have a shot at winning.</span></p>\n<p><i>This post is part of <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction\" target=\"_blank\">Mischiefs of Faction</a>, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system.

But that goal hit a big obstacle on Sunday, when a federal court in Texas&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-texas-transgender-bathroom-lawsuit-20160822-story.html\">temporarily blocked</a> enforcement of a guidance from the Obama administration that seeks to protect trans students in public schools.</p>\n<p>Previously, the administration <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights\">sent out guidelines</a> that told schools they cannot discriminate against transgender students or block them from using the bathroom or locker room for their gender identity.</p>\n<p>The guidance, first reported in the<a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/us/politics/obama-administration-to-issue-decree-on-transgender-access-to-school-restrooms.html\"> New York Times</a>, doesn't set new, legally binding policy.<strong> </strong>Instead, it spells out the Department of Justice and Department of Education's existing policies to federally funded schools, based on the Obama administration's interpretation of federal civil rights law.</p>\n<div class=\"chorus-snippet s-related\" data-analytics-action=\"link:related\" data-analytics-category=\"article\">\n<span class=\"s-related__title\">Related</span><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/5/11592908/transgender-bathroom-laws-rights\">The big political battle over transgender people and bathrooms, explained</a>\n</div>\n<p>But the clarification, which was sent to schools across the country in May, immediately drew controversy from conservative state leaders. Quickly, Texas and 12 other states&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11770580/texas-transgender-bathrooms-ken-paxton-obama\">filed a lawsuit</a> in federal court arguing that the Obama administration's guidance was unconstitutional — an attempt by the president to \"rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people,\" according to Texas Attorney General&nbsp;Ken Paxton, a Republican.</p>\n<p>The federal court in Texas has not yet reached a decision in the case, but it agreed to temporarily block the Obama administration's guidance while the issue is settled in court.</p>\n<p>It also came at a particularly heated time in the political battle over LGBTQ rights. Earlier on, the Justice Department and North Carolina had sued each other over <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/23/11100552/charlotte-north-carolina-lgbtq-pat-mccrory\">the state's anti-LGBTQ law</a>, which effectively blocks trans people from using the bathroom or locker room that matches their gender identity in schools and government buildings.</p>\n<p>The Obama administration was trying to ensure that other states and schools didn't follow North Carolina's lead. But it looks like whether the Obama administration's guidance sticks will be left to federal courts.</p>\n<h3>The Obama administration's guidance tell schools to accommodate trans people — but it's not legally binding</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"US Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL6oNBuHzEhEUKgs82O2rEZqzN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6480123/529771808.jpg\">\n      <cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>US Attorney General Loretta Lynch.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p>The Obama administration's guidelines tell schools that they must allow transgender students to use the bathroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. The rules also apply to sports teams, housing, fraternities, and sororities. This is the administration's longstanding policy, but the guidelines put this policy into very clear writing.</p>\n<p>The Obama administration's basis for this: Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in education. The administration argues that bans against sex discrimination apply to gender identity, since discrimination based on gender identity — and against trans people — is fundamentally rooted in expectations of what people of certain sexes assigned at birth should be like.</p>\n<p>Based on this view, school officials are discriminating — and violating civil rights law — if trans students are blocked from using a bathroom or locker room for their gender identity. After all, forcing trans people to use the facility that doesn't align with their gender identity acts as a reminder that society still isn't completely willing to accept them and their identities, even if trans people pose no danger to anyone else.</p>\n<p>According to the administration's guidelines, schools can adopt changes for \"additional privacy,\" such as privacy curtains or letting students change in bathroom stalls.</p>\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our guidance sends a clear message to transgender students across the country: <a href=\"https://t.co/3IiLyLU7u7\">https://t.co/3IiLyLU7u7</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WxR6VJaR7m\">pic.twitter.com/WxR6VJaR7m</a></p>\n— Vanita Gupta (@CivilRightsAAG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CivilRightsAAG/status/731109001455341568\">May 13, 2016</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</center>\n<p>But not all courts have validated the Obama administration's view. So the guidelines aren't legally binding — and the administration doesn't seem willing to yank federal funding from schools to enforce the guidelines until courts uphold its interpretation of Title IX. (This is Title IX's big enforcement mechanism: If states, cities, or schools violate it, they risk losing billions in federal funding.)</p>\n<p>This is what the legal battle between the Obama administration and conservative state leaders is about. The Obama administration says its reading of federal civil rights law is correct, so all states should either lose federal funding for violating civil rights protections or respect their guidance. But the opposing states claim the administration's interpretation of federal civil rights protections is wrong — and gender identity is not included in the federal laws — so they are well within their rights to bar trans students from using the bathroom for their gender identity.</p>\n<p>The outcome of the legal battle could be a big deal. If courts approve of the Obama administration's interpretation of federal civil rights law, it could effectively expand existing civil rights protections that explicitly ban discrimination based on race and sex, among other traits, to explicitly include gender identity. And that could, in turn, bleed over to federal civil rights laws beyond Title IX and education — such as the Civil Rights Act's protections in the workplace and the Fair Housing Act's provisions for housing.</p>\n<div id=\"vox-lgbtq-civil-rights-protections-1__graphic\" data-analytics-label=\"vox-lgbtq-civil-rights-protections-1:2300\" data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\"></div>\n<div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\n (function() { var l = function() { new pym.Parent( 'vox-lgbtq-civil-rights-protections-1__graphic', '//apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-lgbtq-civil-rights-protections-1/'); }; if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') { var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0], s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/0.4.5/pym.js'; s.onload = l; h.appendChild(s); } else { l(); } })();\n// --></script>\n</div>\n<p>But for now, the Obama administration's guidelines are simply a legally non-binding guidance. Still, they suggest that the Obama administration will attempt legal action against violators. And if courts do ultimately rule in the administration's favor, schools and states could lose billions in federal education funding for violating civil rights laws — a position no public official wants to be caught in. And that could be enough to deter schools and states from adopting policies similar to&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/23/11100552/charlotte-north-carolina-lgbtq-pat-mccrory\">North Carolina's anti-LGBTQ law</a>.</p>\n<h3>This entire issue is based on a big myth about trans people in bathrooms</h3>\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Transgender bathroom bills | 8759\" data-volume-uuid=\"fd6295e6f\" data-volume-id=\"8759\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" id=\"volume-placement-3685\" class=\"volume-video\"></div>\n\n<p>It may appear odd that bathrooms and locker rooms have become such a huge deal in American politics over the past several months. And it is. But what's worse is that this became a huge political battle because of a big myth.</p>\n<p>According to supporters of North Carolina's law, for example, letting trans people use the bathroom for their gender identity would pose a public safety risk. They claim that if trans people can use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, men will take advantage of such policies to disguise themselves as women and sneak into women's bathrooms or locker rooms to sexually assault or harass women.</p>\n<p>Some conservatives have latched onto this myth, which had success with voters in Houston, to oppose laws that ban discrimination against sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, housing, public accommodations, and education. North Carolina's law, for instance, came after Charlotte added sexual orientation and gender identity to its nondiscrimination protections for public accommodations. (More on all of that in <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/5/11592908/transgender-bathroom-laws-rights\">Vox's broader explainer</a>.)</p>\n<p>But even if trans people are allowed to use the bathroom for their gender identity, sexual assault remains illegal. So a legal deterrent to deviant behavior already exists.</p>\n<p>There's also no evidence that nondiscrimination laws — and other policies that also let trans people use the bathroom for their gender identity — lead to sexual assault in bathrooms and locker rooms. In two investigations, Media Matters confirmed with experts and officials in <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/20/debunking-the-big-myth-about-transgender-inclus/198530\">12 states</a> and <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/06/03/17-school-districts-debunk-right-wing-lies-abou/203867\">17 school districts</a> with protections for trans people that they had no increases in sex crimes after they enacted their policies.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Experts say LGBTQ nondiscrimination laws do not lead to sexual crimes in bathrooms.\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uOAUReOiu4I-C7sz9KMTw2APKxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3748966/States-transgender-law.jpg\">\n      <cite><p><a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/20/debunking-the-big-myth-about-transgender-inclus/198530\">Media Matters</a></p></cite>\n  </figure>\n\n<p>Conservatives usually counter that there are examples of men sneaking into women's bathrooms to attack women. But as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/01/chris-sgro/equality-nc-director-no-public-safety-risks-cities/\">PolitiFact reported</a>, none of the examples cited in the US happened after a city or state passed a nondiscrimination law or otherwise let trans people use the bathroom or locker room for their gender identity. Instead, these seem to be examples of men doing awful things regardless of the law — which has, unfortunately, happened since the beginning of civilization.</p>\n<p>One example is a case in Toronto, Canada, which now has a nondiscrimination law, in which a man disguised himself as a woman and attacked women in shelters. But the attacks <a href=\"http://chrismilloy.ca/2014/06/conservative-senator-caught-in-bald-faced-lie-in-attack-on-human-rights-bill/\">happened months before</a> Ontario (Toronto's province) protected trans people in a nondiscrimination law. So the law couldn't have been the cause.</p>\n<p>Still, the myth remains prominent — to the point that the Obama administration felt compelled to release guidelines that make it clear acting on this myth could have very serious repercussions for schools.</p>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000003a54df0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a86b20 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/5/13/11669172/obama-administration-transgender-bathrooms">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x00000003a84208 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a86b20 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 10:55:00 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003a7f460 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a86b20 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="The Obama administration's guidance for transgender people and school bathrooms, explained">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000003a81b70 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a86b20 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 10:55:00 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003a4b660 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a86b20 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x00000003a49f90 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003a4b660 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="German Lopez">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000003a561f0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a86b20 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2016/5/13/11669172/obama-administration-transgender-bathrooms", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a47f38 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -  All">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000004a9a750 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 21:38:40 -0400>, @author=[], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000004aa5d30 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @entry=[...], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[], @xml_stylesheets=[], @feed_type="atom", @feed_subtype="feed", @feed_version="1.0", @version="1.0", @encoding="UTF-8", @standalone=false, @output_encoding=nil>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Content:0x000000039ff5a8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003a47f38 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type="html", @src=nil, @xml=nil, @content="  \n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biaq_1evzz98LPpiM8hGgeIDxMg=/16x0:3961x2630/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50456831/American.militia.bennington.0.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n  <p id=\"g3vIiL\">Do people have a right to defend themselves against a tyrannical government? And does the Second Amendment reinforce that right? Donald Trump appeared to be referring to such a right recently, in his muddled comments about \"Second Amendment people.\" But trying to discern the thinking behind Trump’s thoughtless blather is pointless. Instead, it’s better to consider the guidance of the Constitution and the founders.</p>\n<p id=\"AadapM\">According to the Declaration of Independence, the only legitimate governments are those with the consent of the governed. When a government becomes the enemy and not the defender of human rights, the people can withdraw their consent and set up a new government.</p>\n<p id=\"O9KZsx\">\"Prudence dictates\" against changing long-established governments, or withdrawing consent for \"light and transient causes,\" said the declaration. But by 1776, \"the long train of usurpations and abuses\" by King George’s government had demonstrated \"a design to reduce\" the colonists \"under absolute Despotism.\" The declaration pointed out that the Americans had repeatedly asked their \"British brethren\" to redress the problems, but the British \"have been deaf to the voice of Justice.\" Therefore, \"necessity\" required the Americans to separate from Great Britain, as a last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"IUmkOJ\">Jefferson <a href=\"http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-5212\">later explained</a> that among the sources of the declaration were \"the elementary books of public right,\" such as the works of <a href=\"http://www.davekopel.com/Religion/Catholic-Second-Amendment.pdf\">Cicero</a>, <a href=\"http://davekopel.org/Religion/Scottish-and-English-religious-roots-of-the-right-to-arms.pdf\">Locke</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/07/03/algernon-sidney-a-father-of-the-declaration-of-independence/?utm_term=.64005cbb98dc\">Sidney</a>. Those theorists had agreed that government without consent is the same as robbery; in both cases, forcible self-defense was legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"hU9Dfm\">But once the Americans had won their independence, how could the declaration’s legal principles be applied if an <em>American </em>government became as abusive and obstinate as King George had been?</p>\n<h3 id=\"9nv3Nb\">From the beginning, concerns about tyranny</h3>\n<p id=\"EQOpLT\">When the proposed Constitution was before the people for ratification, many anti-Federalists worried that the new government would be too powerful, and could become tyrannical. In <a href=\"http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa46.htm\">Federalist No. 46</a>, James Madison reassured the public that the many checks and balances in the Constitution — the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, for example — made it very unlikely that a tyrant could seize power. If a tyrant did, he would speedily be deposed by the state governments, who would lead the armed people in the militias.</p>\n<aside id=\"qO0cdi\"></aside>\n<p id=\"bMDMf4\">\"Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation,\" Madison wrote, \"the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.\" By \"simple,\" Madison meant a unitary government, such as France, as opposed to the US Constitution’s system of dividing sovereignty between the federal government and the states.</p>\n<p id=\"2bCuD2\">Madison was following a long tradition in Western Christian thought that the best leaders of resistance to tyranny were \"intermediate magistrates\" — such as local governments and their officials.</p>\n<p id=\"IgE6xY\">The founders rejected the notion that individuals or some group could use armed force just because they did not like a particular law. In fact, they believed quite the opposite: The Constitution specifically empowers Congress \"[t]o provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.\" The power was first exercised during the presidencies of George Washington and John Adams, when the federal government called forth state militias to suppress insurrections known as the Whiskey Rebellion (in western Pennsylvania) and Fries’s Rebellion (in eastern Pennsylvania). Both insurrections had grown out of anti-tax protests, in which mobs crossed the line by using armed force.</p>\n<p id=\"RvvnLF\">In contrast, the American Revolution perfectly fit with the principle of intermediate magistrates: Independence was declared by delegates representing the state governments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3fYkJB\">The right to fight tyranny is universal</h3>\n<p id=\"exGK6T\">The Second Amendment does not create a right of revolution against tyranny. That inherent right is universal. As stated in the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, \"[I]t is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.\" The Universal Declaration was influenced by the Declaration of Independence, thanks in part to the US delegation led by Ambassador  Eleanor Roosevelt (who <a href=\"http://davekopel.org/NRO/2002/Her-Own-Bodyguard.htm\">carried her own handgun</a> for protection).</p>\n<p id=\"P21voh\">The Second Amendment does, however, reinforce the rule of law and anti-tyranny structure of the US Constitution, by ensuring the government cannot disarm the people. In the 2008 case <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html\"><em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em></a>, all nine Justices agreed that the amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for service in the militia. (The justices disagreed about whether the right includes other purposes, such as personal self-defense or hunting.) Why did the founding generation believe that a well-regulated militia was necessary? One reason, observed Justice Antonin Scalia: \"when the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny.\"</p>\n<p id=\"Cfj3jY\">Explaining the proposed Second Amendment, Madison’s ally <a href=\"http://davekopel.org/2A/LawRev/hk-coxe.htm\">Tench Coxe</a>, a delegate to the Continental Congress for Pennsylvania, wrote: \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow-citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.\" Madison thanked Coxe for the newspaper essay<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"O0VfQ5\">Democratic Vice President and Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey, the congressional leader of the civil rights movement, expressed a similar sentiment nearly two centuries later.&nbsp;For three decades after World War II, he was the embodiment of a liberal Democrat. In 1960, Humphrey <a href=\"http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/2amteach/sources.htm#TOC37\">wrote</a>: \"Certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government, no matter how popular and respected, is the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. This is not to say that firearms should not be very carefully used and that definite safety rules of precaution should not be taught and enforced. But the right of citizens to bear arms is just one more guarantee against arbitrary government, one more safeguard against a tyranny which now appears remote in America, but which historically has proved to be always possible.\"</p>\n<p id=\"F4o2Rn\">As Humphrey recognized, there was local tyranny in the Jim Crow system of the South. In the mid-1960s, the Ku Klux Klan was so powerful in southwestern Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana that they called the region \"Klan nation.\" The Klan’s organized terrorism had the tacit acquiescence of local law enforcement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Qyc80H\">Who should be judged a defender of basic rights, and who is just an \"armed hothead\"?</h3>\n<p id=\"KvZYos\">In the summer of 1965 about 20 black army veterans in Jonesboro, Louisiana, founded an armed community defense patrol, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Deacons-Defense-Resistance-Rights-Movement/dp/0807857025/\">\"Deacons for Defense and Justice.\"</a> Inspired by visible public presence of boldly armed men, black attitudes in Jonesboro began to change. Black housekeepers stopped accepting racial taunts, and quit if the taunts continued. \"Armed Negroes Make Jonesboro Unusual Town,\" was the headline of a New York Times article on Jonesboro, on February 21, 1965. The Deacons model spread to other Klan heartlands, and was able to overturn Klan power with scarcely a shot fired.</p>\n<p id=\"Bx7oDf\">In June 1966, after the attempted murder of civil rights leader James Meredith, major civil rights organizations banded together to continue the \"Meredith March against Fear,\" from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi. With Martin Luther King’s consent, armed security was provided the entire way by the Deacons for Defense. As the Deacons example demonstrates, resistance to tyranny does not have to rise to the level of state militias attempting to oust a national dictator. Sometimes, the simple, lawful of carrying firearms for defense of self and others may be all that is needed to safeguard the exercise of other rights, such as free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"vxWIpt\">But hotheads who try to make political statements by armed displays often do not help their cause. Such was the case of the American Indian Movement’s takeover of the Wounded Knee, South Dakota, reservation in 1973, or the 2016 takeover of an unoccupied building at a federal wildlife reserve in eastern Oregon. Arms should be a last resort, not a publicity tactic.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Ammon Bundy, the leader of an anti-government militia, speaks to members of the media in front of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Headquarters on January 6, 2016 near Burns, Oregon.\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kas_vktUkooUd9L3WeLQSMrgU7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6967161/bundy.militia.jpg\">\n      <figcaption>Second Amendment arguments may be abused, as when \"militia\" members took over a National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"9YgCMD\">Today’s world is different from 1791. The genocides of the last century show that a criminal government is even more dangerous than the founders thought. The US military — along with the federal government — has grown more powerful than the founders could have imagined.<b> </b>Yet global military history since 1791 repeatedly demonstrates that mighty armies can be defeated by citizens fighting for the consent of the governed. One thing hasn't changed since the days of the Roman lawyer Cicero: Free republics are sometimes taken over by tyrannical demagogues.</p>\n<p id=\"1FE9JA\">During American history, some members of the party out of power have worried about impending tyranny. Happily, this has never come to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"oVlr46\">Today, some people worry that Donald Trump resembles Hugo Chavez and other fascists. Other people, such as National Review’s Jonah Goldberg in his book <em>Liberal Fascism</em>, describe the similarity of Woodrow Wilson’s nationalist and quasi-socialist programs to those of Mussolini. Goldberg argues that Hillary Clinton would amplify a century-long slide of the American left towards a mild, Americanized version of fascism. The rhetoric and records of Trump and Clinton are not exactly scrupulous about respect for the Constitution, or any other law.</p>\n<p id=\"TbRAAe\">Perhaps, as Madison predicted, all the other checks and balances will always prevent tyranny. But should tyranny ever triumph, the US Constitution provides a mechanism to restore constitutional order. In the vision of Madison, it would be states leading their militias, the militias consisting of the able-bodied male population.</p>\n<p id=\"TTJ84Z\">In a modern sense, the organized portion of the state militia is the State National Guard, and the unorganized portion of the militia is able-bodied males. So we might think of today’s mechanism as governors, hopefully with legislative backing, calling forth whatever parts of their state militias were considered appropriate under the circumstances. As in Madison’s day, militiamen by themselves can rarely defeat a professional army in direct battle. But in modern times as in Madison's day, neither can a professional army always succeed in imposing a dictator’s will throughout a vast and well-armed country.</p>\n<p id=\"QymMeq\">Like the one in Federalist No. 46, this is an \"in extremis,\" largely theoretical, argument.<strong> </strong> The American system has thus far proved strong enough to check the worst characters, such as Richard Nixon. The threat of impeachment, and not revolution, sufficed to end his assault on the rule of law — and that threat, along with the other checks and balances, has always sufficed to prevent dictatorship.</p>\n<p id=\"86yxeS\"><em>David Kopel is research director, Independence Institute, Denver;

But like-minded District and Appeals Court judges will push any new liberal precedents forward and lead the evolution of big-picture constitutional doctrine in its post-Scalia direction. </p>\n<p id=\"tsaJxG\">An odd confluence of circumstances — the elimination of the filibuster for judicial nominees followed by the 2014 midterms leading to an utterly intransigent GOP Senate majority — in President Barack Obama’s second term means that a Clinton administration and a Democratic Senate will face an unusually large number of vacancies and have an unusually easy time filling them.</p>\n<p id=\"KpMBkC\">That will let Clinton staff the lower courts with a big new cohort of judges who’ll be systematically more sympathetic to criminal defendants, labor and environmental plaintiffs, and government regulators — transforming the federal judiciary back into a powerful prop of progressive governance for years to come.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"zyw1Ir\">Nuclear winter on the judiciary </h3>\n<p id=\"wXo3mc\">Judicial nominations in Obama’s first term had an essentially familiar pattern to them, albeit in an extreme and heightened form. Obama was president, and Democrats controlled the Senate. Republicans largely agreed that, in some sense, this meant he was entitled to fill judicial vacancies with Democratic Party appointees. </p>\n<p id=\"ZlDrsV\">But they didn’t have to be happy about it. Delaying tactics were routinely put in place to make filling vacancies an arduous endeavor. And the filibuster rule requiring 60 votes to move on any piece of Senate business served as a powerful practical check on Obama’s freedom of action. Many judges got confirmed, but it was slow, grinding work, and any small vetting problem was enough to consign a nominee to filibuster doom. More outspokenly liberal nominees were also rejected via filibuster, while more moderate ones were allowed to advance to preserve the norms of the system.</p>\n<p id=\"iTW5Pe\">This largely came to an end in Obama’s second term when an escalating game of partisan ping-pong came together to lay the groundwork for a coming Clinton confirmation boom:</p>\n<ol id=\"AKOBoG\">\n<li>With the Democratic Senate margin reduced, Republican obstruction grew bolder and confirmations slowed to a trickle.</li>\n<li id=\"IDyiBT\">Harry Reid and Senate Democrats deployed a long-discussed “nuclear option” — essentially using a majority vote to change the rules — to prevent filibustering of judicial nominees, leading to a brief spurt of confirmations.</li>\n<li id=\"c4sQms\">Republicans won control of the Senate in the 2014 midterms, and responded to Reid’s nuclear call by shutting down confirmations altogether.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"PfGx5z\">That means that if Clinton and Democratic Senate candidates win in November, they’ll have an unusually easy time filling vacancies thanks to the nuclear option, and an unusually large number of vacancies to fill thanks to the near-total confirmation blockade during Obama’s final two years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mzq4W3\">Clinton’s lower court opportunity</h3>\n<p id=\"SyIM18\">The basic picture of a president facing an opposition Senate in his final two years in office merely repeats the circumstances faced by Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and Bush. But as the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/04/12/the-growing-specter-of-vacant-federal-judgeships/\">Brookings Institution’s Russel</a><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/04/12/the-growing-specter-of-vacant-federal-judgeships/\">l</a><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/04/12/the-growing-specter-of-vacant-federal-judgeships/\"> Wheeler</a> notes, “Similarities end with confirmations in that same period.”</p>\n<p id=\"G2bX43\">As of April 2016, he wrote, “district vacancies have almost doubled” to 72 since the 2014 midterms, whereas in “in the comparable time periods for Reagan and Bush, district vacancies declined slightly; for Clinton they increased, but came no where near doubling.” </p>\n<p id=\"cC0hqA\">The upshot is that right now 10 percent of the seats on the federal district court benches are vacant. That number is sure to rise between now and November, both in light of seven currently announced retirements and more broadly because more judges will step down once they know the outcome of the election. And on federal appeals circuits there’s currently a 7 percent vacancy rate. </p>\n<p id=\"VCorXr\">Senate Republicans <em>could </em>have used their leverage over the process to force Obama to fill those seats with moderate nominees. They’ve chosen instead to block everything — gambling on winning in November and having a like-minded president fill them with like-minded judges. </p>\n<p id=\"SAdTeg\">Even as Republican victory has started to look less likely, the party’s internal dynamics have prevented them from shifting to a more compromising posture. And due to the exercise of the nuclear option years earlier, a post-election GOP Senate minority will have no power to stop Clinton from filling the seats as she sees fit. </p>\n<h3 id=\"GbmcYb\">An opportunity for judicial progressives</h3>\n<p id=\"Vfvq23\">The opportunity is particularly exciting to liberals. In part because of the polarized landscape, Clinton will have even less reason than Obama or her husband did to push back on activist pressure to nominate outspoken progressives. Every once in a while, Obama did pass a boldly liberal nominee over to the Senate, typically just to see the nomination killed by Republicans. That’s what happened to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Liu\">Goodwin Liu</a>, for example, in a particularly noteworthy case. </p>\n<p id=\"HWKMbk\">But the nuclear crisis changes the dynamics around this. In a recent Politico story on Obama-era nomination battles, Michael Grunwald recounted the improbable story of how Nina Pillard became a judge on the highly influential DC Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"cVMaop\">\n<p>Pillard, an outspoken feminist litigator and law professor, did not fit the Obama pattern of low-profile nominees with minimal paper trails. In fact, White House sources say they never expected her to get confirmed. They figured she would be a sacrificial lamb, a scalp Republicans could claim while confirming Millett, an uncontroversial appellate lawyer, and hopefully Wilkins, an African-American judge who had been confirmed unanimously to the D.C. district court in 2010.</p>\n<p>But the Republicans decided to filibuster all three nominees, to stop Obama from shifting the balance of the court. They didn’t think they’d pay a political price, since most voters ignore lower-court nominations, while grass-roots conservatives who loathe Obama tend to pay closer attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"CUW3Yr\">Republicans simply assumed that the old bulls of the Democratic Senate caucus, like Vermont’s Pat Leahy, would stop Reid from pulling the trigger on the nuclear option. But the Republican blockade on the DC Circuit ended up, for complicated legal reasons, preventing Obama from filling important vacant executive branch posts on the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. That led Democrats to go nuclear, and meant that Pillard suddenly went from unconfirmable sacrificial lamb to federal judge. </p>\n<p id=\"yIrLRA\">Clinton won’t nominate a full slate of Pillards and Lius. But she will face pressure from progressive groups to lean more in that direction, and the altered political context means there will be little pragmatic case against picking them. Liu’s wife, by the way, is Ann O’Leary, who served as legislative director in Clinton’s Senate office, is also one of the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/16/12500798/clinton-transition-team-salazar\">heads of the Clinton transition team</a> whose job it will be to present the president-elect with a set of names to put forward. </p>\n<h3 id=\"8NDODc\">Nothing better to do</h3>\n<p id=\"OXSVvP\">Last but by no means least, we can expect a substantial judicial legacy from Clinton in part because she’ll be in the unusual position of not having all that much else to do with her time. It’s not inconceivable that she will get some legislating done even if she has to deal with a House Republican majority. But anything that happens under those circumstances would necessarily be the product of long, quiet negotiations and wouldn’t thrill the hearts of activists in the base of Clinton’s coalition. </p>\n<p id=\"Juccxp\">She will, like any new president, face pressure to deliver something for the people who put her in office. But between eight years of activity from the Obama administration and a likely GOP majority in the House, the scope for both executive and legislative action will be limited. </p>\n<p id=\"L18aGB\">Appointing judges who’ll champion the causes of environmentalists, labor unions, racial justice activists, and others is something Clinton not only <em>can</em> get done but will actually have more scope to accomplish than any recent president. </p>\n<p id=\"CuHt6M\">A new era of progressive lower-court judging probably isn’t going to be at the front of anyone’s mind when considering their options in 2016, but when we look back on what’s been accomplished in 2017, it’s likely to be near the top of the list.</p>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x000000038130c8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000038983e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12550852/hillary-clinton-lower-courts">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x0000000388e6b0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000038983e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 10:00:03 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x0000000387cfc8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000038983e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Hillary Clinton will likely have a unique chance to remake the federal judiciary">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x0000000387fde0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000038983e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 10:00:03 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003811728 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000038983e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x000000038100d0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003811728 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="Matthew Yglesias">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x000000038207a0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000038983e0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12550852/hillary-clinton-lower-courts", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003805d60 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -

She’s splitting the sum between the American Civil Liberties Union’s efforts to battle violence against women and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, where she’s volunteered for the past 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"rqd940\">And in a joint statement, both Heard and Depp affirmed that \"neither party has made false accusations for financial gain.\"</p>\n<p id=\"0H4C3I\">In other words: Heard is not a gold digger, and she did not <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/08/15/johnny-depp-cuts-off-finger-amber-heard-photos/\">accuse Depp of cutting off part of his finger and then using the stump to finger paint the words \"Easy Amber\"</a> on a mirror because she thought that would be a cool quick way to make some cash.</p>\n<p id=\"ZO5Y7L\">It’s a shame Heard felt the need to be so emphatic about the fact that she isn’t lying about her domestic violence claims, but it’s not surprising. Ever since she first filed for a restraining order against Depp in May, Heard has done everything we say domestic abuse survivors <em>should</em> do. She went to the police. She provided copious documentation. She went above and beyond to prove she wasn’t in it for the money.</p>\n<p id=\"hPEnRs\">People still insisted she was lying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uko0zi\">The history of Heard’s domestic violence allegations spans at least two years</h3>\n<p id=\"0zmwuR\">On May 21, Heard says <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/johnny-depp-amber-heard-divorce-settlement-1201837685/\">she asked a friend to call the police</a> after Depp hit her with an iPhone and struck her. When they arrived, Hear told them she and Depp had only been arguing — which she now says was an attempt to protect Depp’s career. (It’s <a href=\"http://www.ncdsv.org/images/southtownstar_whywomenlieaboutdv_5-21-09.pdf\">extremely common</a> for victims of domestic abuse to feel the need to protect their abusers.)</p>\n<p id=\"LgOmTM\">According to <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/news/190049_amber_heard_texts_from_2014_detail_alleged_assault_by_johnny_depp_exclusive/\">text messages obtained by Entertainment Weekly</a>, the May 2016 incident wasn’t the first time Depp had attacked Heard. Dated two years earlier, in May 2014, the messages detail an incident in which Depp kicked Heard. They also refer to a history of abuse. \"He’s done this many times before … and I always stay,\" Heard writes. \"Always believe he's going to get better...And then every 3 or so month [sic], I'm in the exact same position.\"</p>\n<p id=\"z1DMzs\">The day after the May 21 call to police, Heard and Depp separated. A day later, <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/news/189602_amber_heard_files_for_divorce_from_johnny_depp_after_1_year/\">Heard filed for divorce</a>. And a few days later, <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/768602/johnny-depp-amber-heard-s-divorce-restraining-order-drama-criminal-lawyer-weighs-in\">Heard filed for a restraining order</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ThIX9s\">Gossip coverage was immediately skeptical</h3>\n<p id=\"wlmbwo\"><a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/05/27/amber-heard-domestic-violence-johnny-depp-restraining-order/\">TMZ broke the news</a> of Heard’s request for a restraining order with a deeply skeptical post, whose second sentence reads, \"Sources connected to Johnny are calling BS, saying Amber ‘is an affront to real victims of domestic violence.’\" The story also notes, coyly, \"It's interesting ... she's asking for a temporary restraining order claiming there's an immediate threat of harm, but Depp has been out of town since Wednesday promoting his new movie.\"</p>\n<p id=\"HTOruX\">The comments left by readers are more than skeptical. \"Everything is a made up story from Amber's mouth,\" one says. \"She is so vindictive-what is it she really wants? No. couldn't be all this is to get money!\"</p>\n<p id=\"nvu9Rv\">\"She has proved time after time she is after the money,\" another says. \"its a shame that she would try to get so much publicity from something soo serious.\"</p>\n<p id=\"tjij4N\">Then the evidence emerged: pictures of the bruises on Heard’s face, the broken champagne bottles Heard said Depp threw at her, the shattered glass on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"geVA1J\"><a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/05/27/amber-heard-johnny-depp-domestic-violence/\">TMZ’s commenters were having none of i</a><a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/05/27/amber-heard-johnny-depp-domestic-violence/\">t</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"KHi8l0\">\"She’s in it for the money,\" wrote one.</p>\n<p id=\"35pmP7\">\"I don’t believe a word this whore has to say,\" said another.</p>\n<p id=\"vGP32s\">Not long after, <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/06/06/amber-heard-witnesses-no-bruising-apartment/\">TMZ published an article</a> alleging that Heard had absolutely no bruises on her face two days after Depp supposedly attacked her. \"She is a lying piece of poo,\" one commenter opined.</p>\n<p id=\"IXvsWV\">Meanwhile, the comedian Doug Stanhope had<strong> </strong>published an op-ed at the Wrap stating that Heard was in fact the villain in the situation. \"Johnny Depp got used, manipulated, set up and made to look like an a–hole,\" <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/johnny-depp-is-being-blackmailed-by-amber-heard-heres-how-i-know-guest-column/\">Stanhope wrote</a>. \"And he saw it coming and didn’t or couldn’t do anything to stop it.\"</p>\n<p id=\"cz6SHq\">It’s true that no one would think TMZ’s comment section is the place to look for feminist-friendly debate. But TMZ is also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/inside-harvey-levins-tmz\">one of the biggest and most influential sites in the gossip industry</a>. Its writers regularly break news — including the fact that Heard was seeking a restraining order — and their coverage sets the tone for the rest of the culture. If they suggest a woman is probably lying about domestic violence, that becomes the dominant narrative for a good long while afterward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4IMIwq\">The gossip press’s response painted Heard as the villainous wife from <em>Gone Girl</em>\n</h3>\n<p id=\"W3YUVW\">What emerges from this type of coverage is a narrative in which a young woman fabricates a story about domestic abuse and<strong> </strong>cynically manufactures several years’ worth of evidence to support it, which she then leaks slowly to the police and the public in a vicious attempt to slander her husband and steal all his money.</p>\n<p id=\"HDGWjs\">It’s a narrative in which it seems implausible that a woman who is frequently followed by paparazzi might have covered her bruises with makeup when she went out in public. No, she must have inflicted the bruises on herself just before she went to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"ScYUb0\">In other words, this is a narrative in which people are more willing to believe that <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2267998/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Gone Girl</a></em><em> </em>is a documentary than that Heard is telling the truth, and that her much older, richer, and more powerful husband abused her. We’re about five minutes away from someone suggesting that Heard killed Neil Patrick Harris mid-coitus — that’s how desperate some people are to ignore the fact that the evidence against Depp is extremely compelling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"IlQoU6\">The \"Heard is lying\" narrative is an extremely familiar one</h3>\n<p id=\"QEq039\">It’s not really surprising that so many people think Heard is lying. That’s what usually happens when a woman accuses a powerful and beloved man of hurting her. But it’s telling that this narrative persists even after Heard went out of her way to knock it down.</p>\n<p id=\"X85K4Z\">Traditionally, when a woman accuses a famous man of hurting her, the responses are 1) there’s no proof, and 2) she’s just doing it for the money and the attention. It’s a ready-made narrative we return to over and over, so there are many versions of it, but <a href=\"http://nationalreport.net/bill-cosby-rape-accusations-absolutely-without-merit-greedy-charlatans-exposed/\">here’s a nice clear example</a> in National Report’s fervent defense of Bill Cosby:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of these depreciated old skanks will fabricate some ludicrous tale of sexual assault decades after they claim the incident(s) occurred. This way they can destroy reputations, smear an individual’s successful career, and in this case taint Cosby’s good name by rousting a bunch of dizzy unattractive lesbians <em>[I am cutting this for length as the description of angry feminists goes on for quite a few lines]</em> … though no evidence exists to support their fabricated malicious and destructive fictional accounts of abuse.</p>\n<p>And in today’s digital age where any moron can claim anything they want and spread it across the Internet we’re already seeing the damning effects of groundless accusations. In spite of not having a single shred of evidence against Cosby, Netflix, NBC and TV Land have terminated future projects involving Cosby, or have removed Cosby entertainment from their programming. These inconsequential women well know the wreckage they can cause by making unsubstantiated and baseless allegations. They also know important luminaries who’ve earned their wealth and reputations through hard work, education, charitable works and living a moral life in the footsteps of Jesus will settle out of court to avoid enormous legal fees, courtroom drama and bad press.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"tZrZeT\">This passage is the logical underpinning for comments like \"she is a lying piece of poo\" or \"she is after the money.\" The woman is always after the money; she didn’t go to the cops when it happened; there’s no evidence; she’s just trying to destroy a good man’s life; and we know all this because it’s always what we say when a woman accuses a famous man of hurting her.</p>\n<p id=\"shTLFH\">And we repeat the same story on a smaller scale when non-famous women accuse non-famous men of hurting them. We say these women are almost always liars, that they weren’t really hurt, that they’re just trying to destroy innocent men. Statistically, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/12/6/7342971/rape-myths-sexual-assault\">that’s almost never true</a>, but we say it anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6ZoeKY\">Heard’s experience is a perfect example of how poorly we treat victims of domestic abuse</h3>\n<p id=\"IQQXcE\">Here’s the thing: Heard <em>did </em>go to the cops when it happened. She went to the police with fresh, visible bruises on her face.</p>\n<p id=\"mYr3AL\">She <em>did </em>provide evidence. She provided photographs and witness testimony and text messages that back up her story.</p>\n<p id=\"zJ8xAG\">She’s <em>not </em>after the money. She gave it all away.</p>\n<p id=\"mDdHhb\">She was, in every way, exactly the kind of victim we say women should be if they want us to believe them.</p>\n<p id=\"krNbuB\">It didn’t matter. We still said she was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"HGALW1\">Heard ultimately <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/08/16/amber-heard-johnny-depp-settlement-domestic-violence-divorce/\">dropped the domestic violence charges</a> and settled the divorce out of court. When <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/08/18/amber-heard-johnny-depp-settlement-money-charity/\">TMZ reported that she would be donating her settlement money</a>, the commenters reacted exactly the way you would expect by now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Her lies are all around. She said she earned $10,000 a month but spent $50,000 so she needed alimony from JD to live her lifestyle, but now she's giving all this money to charity? Really??? Crazy and liar....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"yJyyhP\">Our treatment of Heard proves that it doesn’t really matter how women act when they accuse men of hurting them. We don’t really care. We’ll find a way to call them liars no matter what they do.</p>\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000003737de8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003805d60 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/19/12555646/amber-heard-johnny-depp-domestic-abuse-divorce">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x000000037fbec8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003805d60 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 09:37:00 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x000000037ee9f8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000003805d60 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Amber Heard did what abuse victims are “supposed” to do.

Throughout the season, I’ve been impressed with both the story being told and the show’s sense of proportion and depth.</p>\n<p id=\"JnTmcX\">\"Ordinary Death,\" <em>The Night Of</em>’s seventh and penultimate episode, all but set the table for the show’s end by throttling us with an uncomfortable idea: that this grand fight to save Naz might actually not be worth it. That he’s already a lost soul, a man who’s slipped into a dive that he can’t pull himself out of. That maybe he isn’t who we thought he was.</p>\n<p id=\"TuGRMo\">The queasy asthmatic kid who was afraid of girls is now doing drugs and has become a stone-cold accomplice to a murder. If the first few episodes of the season were determined to present him as incapable of killing, these last few, especially \"Ordinary Death,\" seek to unspool those ideas and see what comes tumbling out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FqRJUp\">What else has Naz lied about?</h3>\n<p id=\"u46s9B\">\"Ordinary Death\" sees the courtroom procedural portion of <em>The Night Of </em>shift to Chandra and Stone’s offensive. They call into question the state’s experts, while bringing in their own to open up the idea that Andrea might have been a damaged, drug-using junkie. Everything seems to be going well, until they’re hit with a surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"mxdI90\">Naz’s basketball coach from his previous school mentions that Naz once put two kids in the hospital. It’s a shock to Naz’s defense team, who only know about one violent incident — a different one — in his past. Chandra is blindsided by the revelation, which completely derails her argument that Naz is a good kid who was once lost control in the face of racism and bigotry.</p>\n<p id=\"q3f7MR\">Naz has become unreliable and untrustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"DYxdOY\">But it’s also not like Naz has proved otherwise during his stint in prison. He’s adapted so well to being one of Freddy’s boys, gaming the system to his advantage. At the end of \"Ordinary Death,\" he’s creating a crucial distraction, allowing Freddy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"uNF84w\">He also kisses Chandra in this episode, in a scene intercut with flashes of him kissing Andrea. The way it’s edited creates a slip of suspicion toward the end of the sequence, where the camera lingers on Naz. It’s almost as if he’s calculating his next move, which may include betraying Chandra — the<a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_8_current_clients_specific_rules.html\"> American Bar Association states </a>that lawyers shouldn’t have sexual relationships with their clients. It’s a signal to the audience that even though this guy may not have killed Andrea, he might have no hesitation killing someone now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tnObHi\">Is Naz worth saving? Is justice even worth it?</h3>\n<h3>  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Naz\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQXziNK41HQwjGGe20ZQVlG9JC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6970529/MV5BMjE0MTA4OTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTA5Mjc3OTE_._V1_SY1000_SX1500_AL_.0.jpg\">\n      <cite>HBO</cite>\n  </figure>\n</h3>\n<p class=\"caption\">Naz and Freddy. (The Night Of/HBO)</p>\n<p id=\"EtciNk\">To pay for Naz’s trial and all the repercussions that his arrest has set in motion (the taxi Naz’s father shares keeps coming up), his parents go to a pawn shop and sell of some of their goods. It’s a sad, heavy scene, perhaps because I find pawn shops to be gateways to worlds of depression. But also because it reveals the sacrifices that everyone who loves Naz is making, and they have no idea what’s happened to him in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"7mJh1b\">It’s a damning portrayal of the criminal justice system’s ability to corrupt, but also one that shows the devotion and bonds between parents and their kids. Naz’s parents will do anything for him — they will sell everything they own and clean restrooms for their son.</p>\n<p id=\"CHythl\">That’s all but invisible to Naz. And, reflexively, the man he’s so quickly become is invisible to his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"PTogBA\">Naz’s parents still very much believe that Naz is the victim of a big misunderstanding, that he’s incapable of killing. At one point during the trial, his mother is so disgusted by the allegations that she leaves the room. Her outburst gets her a lecture about optics from Chandra, who tells her that every little moment matters because the jury is looking at every single thing someone says or does in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"deUB94\">Never mind that Naz is now sporting finger tattoos and a buzzed head.</p>\n<p id=\"TpGAQv\">Would his parents still sacrifice everything if they knew what he’s been up to at Rikers? If their lives are so painful now, what happens to them if Naz is released from prison? What kind of resentment does Naz have for the justice system? Does Naz’s freedom have the potential to be worse for his parents than his incarceration?</p>\n<p id=\"CQveQY\">\"Ordinary Death\" nimbly floats these ideas without fully crystallizing them. I found myself already writing a story in my head where Naz is acquitted of Andrea’s murder but ends up going back to jail because he’s incapable of living a normal life after what he’s been through.</p>\n<p id=\"gvLo2t\">It’s made me think a lot about how this experience will shape the future for <em>The Night Of</em>’s characters. Even if we only have them for one more episode.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>How a TV show gets made</h3>\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"How a TV show gets made | 7716\" data-volume-uuid=\"9388357e8\" data-volume-id=\"7716\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" id=\"volume-placement-6567\" class=\"volume-video\"></div>\n\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x000000035763b0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000035d6238 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12532378/the-night-of-season-1-episode-7-ordinary-death-recap">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x000000035d4528 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000035d6238 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 08:20:03 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x000000035bef70 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000035d6238 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="The Night Of season 1, episode 7: \"Ordinary Death\" asks if Naz is worth saving after all">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x000000035c9b50 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000035d6238 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 08:20:03 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003574ab0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000035d6238 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x00000002df6a40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000003574ab0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="Alex Abad-Santos">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x000000035778f0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x000000035d6238 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12532378/the-night-of-season-1-episode-7-ordinary-death-recap", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002deac40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -  All">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000004a9a750 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 21:38:40 -0400>, @author=[], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000004aa5d30 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @entry=[...], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[], @xml_stylesheets=[], @feed_type="atom", @feed_subtype="feed", @feed_version="1.0", @version="1.0", @encoding="UTF-8", @standalone=false, @output_encoding=nil>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Content:0x00000002d9ddf0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002deac40 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type="html", @src=nil, @xml=nil, @content="  \n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ku2FGzv1nNp3oXWZmCDaDRK6BAc=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50455813/Betsy_Falcon_1.0.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n  <p id=\"K0fRHB\">I’ve never known exactly when a friend is going to die — until today.

Three weeks later I got an email from Betsy, an artist at the end of a three-year battle with ALS. The subject line read, \"Planet Earth.\" She wrote that she was \"preparing her departure,\" which she called \"yet another great adventure.\" She’d met with doctors, filed paperwork, and picked the date when she could self-administer the drug. It would be July 24. Sunset. She called it her \"Rebirth Ceremony.\"</p>\n<p id=\"E9yuXF\">Her phrasing made it sound as if I’d been invited to a swinging shindig.</p>\n<p id=\"e69ZiO\">A number of thoughts flew through my mind, \"I’m not worthy,\" chief among them. But if your name makes that list, there is only one answer. I RSVP’d as if it were Sunday brunch. \"I’m in!\"</p>\n<p id=\"lb8ZSl\">We soon received rules of conduct, subject line, \"The Party\": 1) No crying in front of Betsy, 2) only joyful and light interactions, and 3) Betsy may cry in front of us. There was a schedule, much like a wedding itinerary, which included happy hour cocktails leading up to Sunday’s Rebirth Ceremony. There was even a rehearsal dinner (well, pizza and a Jodorowsky movie) the night before. I locked in for a mind-bending weekend in Ojai.</p>\n<p id=\"fHC8DK\">A cursory internet search did not give me any answers as to whether this was the first assisted suicide in California — but it certainly gave many vehement arguments against what I was about to do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nEEAR0\">The arguments against assisted suicide</h3>\n<p id=\"dfOYnE\">It hadn’t occurred to me that assisted suicide could be wrong, because it was clearly what Betsy wanted. I knew what it was like to watch someone slowly and painfully expire. When my father-in-law died of cancer, we clung to his precious last moments of consciousness, fearful the palliative drugs would take him away too soon. In retrospect, his suffering could have been avoided if he’d taken the drugs sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"CzaPpC\">But now I was reading this was a \"slippery slope.\" Poor people may be socially pressured into death, to spare their family resources. Insurance companies might withhold treatment from someone with low odds of survival because it’s cheaper to simply let them die.</p>\n<p>I already had nerves, but now they were amplified. According to one blog, I should \"protest what she was attempting, in order to give her strength to live on.\" Maybe if her friends refused to let her die, she would write a book, become the next Stephen Hawking? Were we making a huge mistake?</p>\n<h3 id=\"rt2OL4\">Betsy’s ALS diagnosis was the least interesting thing about her</h3>\n<p id=\"RSv9tM\">My friends and I rented a house in Ojai, close to Betsy’s, for the weekend. We understood our job was to have as much fun as possible, so she experienced authentic joy in her final hours. All jokes must be <em>actually </em>funny, all laughter legit. We would <em>not</em> eff this up.</p>\n<p id=\"YXKDeA\">Our combined anxiety vibrated as we numbly ate breakfast before heading to Betsy’s house.</p>\n<p id=\"M14QrW\">As we ate, a quiet man named Mat whom I’d known for years but never really talked to, spoke up. He told us, shy at first, that his dad died of ALS when he was 16. Of course, there was no End of Life Option Act then. The \"natural way\" to go from ALS is suffocation or choking. Mat’s father did not want either. One day, Mat’s father said goodbye to his kids. They told him they loved him and weren’t allowed to see him again. He stopped eating. The \"most painless and swiftest\" way to go took six days.</p>\n<p id=\"tVO0bM\">Mat was grateful Betsy could depart painlessly and surrounded by loved ones.<strong> </strong>During a visit earlier in the year, he asked Betsy if it was hard to plan her own death. She smiled and responded, \"Dying is easy. Try living in this body. That’s hard.\" After that, I didn’t look back.</p>\n<p id=\"XuB4UI\">Betsy’s ALS diagnosis was the least interesting thing about her: She was a brilliant, motorcycle-driving, world-traveling pioneer of <a href=\"http://queenofplastics.com/Baroque-Series\">laser-cutting sculpture </a>— who just happened to be a statuesque beauty with a keen sense of style.</p>\n<p id=\"9lLfuD\">We dressed to the nines for her Rebirth Ceremony. On a scale of \"natural\" to \"drag queen,\" I was a solid Liza Minnelli.</p>\n<p id=\"LEqC8s\">I reviewed what I knew would happen: At 4 pm, we would have tamales. From 5 to 7 pm we would drink cocktails while picking out Betsy souvenirs from her remaining belongings — \"everything must go.\" Around 7, Betsy would don a ceremonial Japanese robe and go up the hill by her house. There we would gather as she took a Jell-O-based concoction of pentobarbital and morphine, a barbiturate similar to what Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland took at the time of their accidental deaths. Old Hollywood style.</p>\n<p id=\"Lgd8w2\">The drug had to be self-administered, and there was a lot of it. She had to stay strong enough to move her hand to her mouth and swallow the entire dose. She would go into a coma in five minutes, and then it would take one to 48 hours to reach her final destination. Would she get it all down? Would it stay down?</p>\n<h3 id=\"13rTNb\">\"I am so ready to leave this body\"</h3>\n<p id=\"2nHKBJ\">When we arrived at Betsy’s house she was laughing, surrounded by friends who hugged her and took photos. Her relatives, a Catholic nurse among them, were curious how we \"young people\" felt about the whole thing. Girded by Mat’s story, we focused on the positives. One friend brought balloons altered to read, \"Happy Re-Birthday.\" Betsy’s photographer friend documented everything like a wedding.</p>\n<div class=\"align-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4bAsZrWK2KJwGcPz6UYhIEPMFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6966827/1-ws7P059xZ5gv4oHCZ4-8_g.jpeg\">\n      <cite>Niels Alpert</cite>\n      <figcaption>Happy re-birthday balloons.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"xIcvGU\">Betsy wanted her things to \"live on through us,\" so a fashion show emerged as we tried on her clothes. I found a red dress from her performance art piece at the Getty Museum, a stunning number so complicated I asked her professional stylist friend Amanda for help. Amanda was stumped too, and we realized if we didn’t ask Betsy how it worked before 7 pm, we’d never figure it out.</p>\n<p id=\"te9aly\">Gandalf said, \"It doesn’t matter how much time you have, it’s what you do with it.\" When Betsy had exactly two hours left, she spent 10 minutes explaining out how the hell to put on a wrap dress.</p>\n<p id=\"wJKTTD\">Betsy’s suffering was palpable beneath the joy. Layers of fatigue and disappointment hid behind her eyes as she tried to communicate. Days earlier she’d texted a friend, \"I am so ready to leave this body.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"L499Ew\">What happens at an assisted suicide party</h3>\n<p id=\"9Gn8Da\">An hour before the ceremony, she answered some questions I’d emailed her earlier. We sat together as she spoke and spelled out answers, with the help of a translator. To someone with a terminal illness who is considering suicide, she advised, \"know yourself and your strengths\" and \"leverage your resources to create a positive experience.\"</p>\n<p id=\"n1QiXW\">How did she curate a guest list for \"the most exclusive party of the century\"? She originally only wanted five people. But once her caregiver typed up the email, it expanded to 30 loved ones who inspired her — she didn’t think we’d come. It was only after being flooded with RSVPs she thought, \"Well, I guess we’ll get tamales.\" As we spoke, Mat, who was an architect, periodically checked in to clarify the \"floor plan\" of the ceremony site, ensuring that everything was just so. He wore a kimono top she’d bought on a trip to Japan. She loved it.</p>\n<p id=\"beZKZV\">Around 6 pm we were asked to step outside so Betsy’s family could have some alone time. It was golden hour, the sun low in the sky. A Tesla Model X with \"Falcon wing\" doors was at the ready to transport her to the ceremony site. Betsy’s father stepped outside and thanked us for coming. Nothing will ever prepare you for the face of a man about to lose his daughter. His strength and love, as he was relentlessly tested by his artist daughter, until the very end. It was heartbreaking.</p>\n<p id=\"4ALdHk\">We were instructed to walk up the hill to a vista where white shade tents, a massage table, and an altar stood before white folding chairs — once again, like a wedding. We hiked up a perilously steep snakehole-filled hill, decked out in glorious Betsy attire, and prevented one another from \"stealing the show\" by falling off the cliff.</p>\n<p id=\"YWQjnb\">She was lifted into the Tesla X, laughing with joy as the Falcon doors closed, radiant in her blue and white robe. Despite our collective uncertainty, we cheered her on as she was wheeled into the ceremony site. Lots of hooting and hollering, as if she’d just kissed the bride.</p>\n<p id=\"aEv2xY\">She lay on the massage table as soothing chime music played. Caretakers futzed over her hair but kept getting it wrong until she mumbled, \"Amanda!\" Her stylist friend came and lovingly finger-combed her hair until it was perfect and tied her kimono sash into a pristine bow. She looked like the famous&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-ophelia-n01506\" target=\"_blank\">Millais \"Ophelia\"</a> painting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5d7jJB\">\"You’re beautiful. See you later.\"</h3>\n<p id=\"myCFB1\">There was an awkward pause in which we heard the medicine was delayed due to \"technical issues.\" In this extended silence, sniffles from the crowd betrayed us – we had broken the first rule of the day: No crying in front of Betsy. I looked around at the tear-streaked cheeks of 30 friends trying to keep it together. The sun glowed gently on Betsy’s face. Her caregiver arrived with the medicine, and we were instructed to leave so she could consume the entire dose without distraction. I walked past Betsy, smiled, and said, \"You’re beautiful. See you later.\" Her face was full of tears.</p>\n<p id=\"avTHAy\">We walked down the hill and heard a primal scream.</p>\n<p id=\"LCJuWH\">My first thought was that Betsy was mad at us for crying and making her sad. Another friend thought she was unleashing her rage and frustration at this disease that robbed her of everything she had. A third said there was no way she was physically capable of making the sound — it was someone else. Regardless of what it meant, it was a reflection. Death has no answers, it just holds up a mirror and asks who you are and who you want to be.</p>\n<p id=\"Utx4TJ\">Back at the house, we sat on the porch in the twilight. Most cried. A few chanted ohms, in hopes it might \"energetically\" help her take the medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"pgJVPM\">After about 15 minutes, we got an update: She’d successfully taken all the medicine and was in a coma. The doctor said her heart was strong. It would be many hours, possibly a day, before she passed. Guests dispersed, and she was moved into the house. Per her request — and only after the doctor assured us we couldn’t possibly wake her — her friend and I rubbed frankincense and various oils on her hands and feet. As I touched her, she made a joyful sigh and smiled from another dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"AmdUE4\">It was time to leave her family in peace. We walked outside and gazed at the stars. Before we made it to the car, her brother-in-law came out and told us she had passed. It was 10:35 pm.</p>\n<p id=\"jLqm53\">We were there for her, but also for ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"eXoeww\">I got to be there for a friend. Mat got to see ALS end better for Betsy than it did for his father. Others were there out of love, curiosity, a fascination with mortality, a sense of being part of history. All of the above.</p>\n<p id=\"Nne9JS\">I can’t help but wonder what could have been if my father-in-law had an end-of-life option. It’s not for everyone, but for Betsy it was the best path. Does the law change the way we die? Maybe. While it provides the opportunity to spare horrific suffering, others must be protected from the \"slippery slope.\" It’s an option that must never be offered, only demanded as a last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"kan802\">Surrounded by devoted family, friends, and former lovers adorned in her fabulous clothes, Betsy gave a carefully art-directed glimpse into life’s most mystifying and inevitable moment. I’m glad I got to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"thEGrV\"><a href=\"http://imdb.com/name/nm1580045/\"><em>Kestrin Pantera</em></a><em> is a writer/director whom the New York Times called \"a force.\" Her award-winning feature film, </em><a href=\"http://letsruinit.com/\">Let's Ruin It With Babies</a><em>, headlined several international film festivals and had a limited theatrical release in 2014.

Some of those Republican appointees nonetheless turned out to be liberals, but even taking that into account, the Court hasn’t been majority liberal <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/after-45-years-of-conservative-rulings-heres-what-a-liberal-supreme-court-would-do/2016/02/19/efa63ad4-d589-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html?utm_term=.19561e3f49c3\">since 1971</a>, when William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell joined.</p>\n<p id=\"vkqwpH\">That hasn’t stopped the Court from evolving in a progressive direction at times.

But though Senate Republicans have denied they’ll confirm him in the lame-duck session this winter, should Hillary Clinton win they might be tempted to confirm him lest she name a more liberal nominee. Either way, the result is a moderate to liberal justice in Scalia’s seat, moving the Court appreciably to the left.</p>\n<p id=\"HTgBK2\">Clinton also stands a good chance of replacing the moderate-to-conservative Anthony Kennedy (who recently turned 80) with a reliable liberal, and keeping Ruth Bader Ginsburg (83 and a two-time cancer survivor) and Stephen Breyer’s (78) seats in liberal hands. The result would be a solid 6-3 liberal majority of a kind not seen in many decades.</p>\n<p id=\"fmyX0H\">The implications of such a shift are massive. The Court is not a legislative body, and it can’t simply undo all of the conservative rulings of recent decades. The doctrine of stare decisis means the Court tries not to contradict its past rulings except in rare cases. But after speaking to a number of prominent legal scholars and experts, it appears there are some notable areas where a liberal Court could make a significant difference.</p>\n<p id=\"x4olLv\">A liberal Court could end long-term solitary confinement. It could mandate better prison conditions in general, making it more costly to maintain mass incarceration. It could conceivably end the death penalty. It could uphold tough state campaign finance rules and start to move away from <em>Citizens United</em>. It could start to develop a robust right to vote and limit gerrymandering. It could strengthen abortion rights, moving toward viewing abortion rights as a matter of equal protection for women.</p>\n<p id=\"XnicMd\">If Donald Trump wins in November, this is all moot. But if he loses, as polls&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/a/trump-tax\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly indicate</a>, the dawn of a new era of liberal jurisprudence could be upon us.</p>\n<a id=\"solitary\"></a>\n<h3>This could be the end of solitary confinement</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"prison stock photo\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qn3BziqJm3QR_9i43gJb61jQg54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4675997/104379109.jpg\">\n      <cite>American Stock Archive/Archive Photos/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>The most abusive treatments in American prisons could be curbed.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"hy6sFB\">Let’s start with perhaps the biggest thing that could happen under a liberal Court, perhaps even a Court where another conservative replaces Scalia: the end of long-term solitary confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"W6OQg7\">In 2015, Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in <em><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1428_1a7d.pdf\">Davis v. Ayala</a></em>, a death penalty case in which the Court (joined by Kennedy) sided against the defendant. Nevertheless, Kennedy used his concurrence to unleash a bracing jeremiad against the evils of solitary confinement, in which the defendant had been held for most of his more than 25 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"ruP2WG\">\"Research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price,\" Kennedy wrote. \"In a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.\"</p>\n<p id=\"bnVYwY\">The implication was clear: Kennedy wanted advocates to bring a case challenging the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement on the grounds that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. He <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/justice-kennedy-says-make-my-day-solitary\">basically dared them to</a>, and suggested that if such a case reached the Court, he’d be inclined to limit the practice. With four reliable liberals already on the Court and likely to join him, it’s quite likely that such a case would end with solitary confinement sharply limited.</p>\n<p id=\"mOsIi2\">Sharon Dolovich, a law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the university’s<em> </em>Prison Law &amp; Policy Program, describes solitary confinement as the \"one major unresolved issue\" in criminal justice \"that is definitely going to come up\" in the next few years.</p>\n<p id=\"Vk19BE\">It’s a long time coming. At any given moment, about <a href=\"http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/\">80,000 to 100,000 people</a> are held in solitary confinement in the US; in many states, the average stint in solitary lasts years. And it’s been that way at least since the 1980s, without any federal court intervention to halt it.</p>\n<p id=\"dtHvlk\">\"There has not been one federal court that has affirmatively found extended solitary confinement to be per se unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment,\" Dolovich recalls. \"And that is in spite of the fact that even under the relatively unprotective  Eighth Amendment doctrine, there is no question that solitary confinement is unconstitutional.\"</p>\n<p id=\"lGZswq\">That doctrine, Dolovich explains, requires plaintiffs alleging a constitutional violation to show that prison officials were \"<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-7376.ZO.html\">deliberately indifferent</a> to a substantial risk of serious harm,\" or \"deliberately indifferent to a basic human need.\" The Court has equated deliberate indifference with a recklessness standard, which requires that prison administrators know there’s a risk that what they’re doing could seriously harm the prisoner.</p>\n<p>\"Given what everybody knows about solitary confinement, that would be easy to show,\" Dolovich says. Then the plaintiff must show there’s a substantial risk of serious harm, or of being deprived of a basic human need, due to solitary confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"KY34bE\">\"There’s so much data now — physiological data, psychological data, reentry data — there’s so much data making clear the extended physical, psychological, and emotional trauma that people suffer in extended solitary confinement,&nbsp;it would be so easy for the Court just to point to it all and conclude there’s an objective harm,\" Dolovich says.</p>\n<p>Were the Supreme Court to strike down or limit long-term solitary confinement in one case on those grounds, it would  open the door for lower courts to honor additional challenges, eventually leading to change across the system. And it wouldn’t require rethinking Eighth Amendment doctrine to be more friendly to prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"1sjNGS\">Jonathan Simon, a law professor and director of the Center for the Study of Law and Society at UC Berkeley, agrees that solitary confinement is on \"the verge of being found unconstitutional, at least in its most excessive forms.\" Just what \"excessive\" means there is, naturally, a matter of debate, and Simon cautions that the Court could err on the side of giving prisons too much leeway.</p>\n<p id=\"ilusFg\">He notes that <em>Ashker v. Brown</em>, a recent case <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/scaling-back-solitary/403441/\">challenging solitary confinement in California</a> that ended in a settlement rather than reaching the Supreme Court, \"involved a class of inmates that had been held more than 10 years, and the settlement will still allow people to be held up to five years, and even after that they can still be held in solitary if they’re given programming and special services.\"</p>\n<p>By contrast, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture has called for an <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097#.V7I5RJMrL6A\">absolute ban on solitary confinement lasting 15 days or more</a>. \"I’m not sure Kennedy or any justice would go nearly that far,\" Simon says.</p>\n<p id=\"6UZ5PM\">But even if the Court were to only place a five-year maximum on periods in solitary confinement, that would be a significant step forward. If the Court is bold enough to accept the UN standard and place a hard two-week limit, then tens of thousands of prisoners would be spared a truly devastating punishment that <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/30/hellhole\">many medical experts believe to be a form of torture</a>.</p>\n<a id=\"prison\"></a>\n<h3>The Court could make it more costly to maintain mass incarceration</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"prison\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y01-HNwhiod5evduwCO1WpBNiJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3872460/shutterstock_174659255.0.jpg\">\n      <cite><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\">Shutterstock</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>Locking people up costs money — and locking them up humanely costs more.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"d0VpFP\">Solitary confinement is perhaps the most shockingly cruel condition of imprisonment in the United States, but the sheer scale of <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8913297/mass-incarceration-maps-charts\">mass incarceration</a> is also an issue in need of addressing. And because federal courts have the ability to affect policy at both the federal and state level, they can have considerable influence on the incarceration rate going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"ibigHv\">Both Dolovich and Simon were skeptical that outright challenges to legislative sentencing statutes like mandatory minimums could prevail. \"At the end of the day, the ability of courts to control the level of incarceration is relatively weak compared to legislatures who can change the underlying sentencing structure,\" Simon warns. But one thing the Court can do is raise the cost of incarceration by insisting upon prisoners' rights to humane conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"0F7slZ\">The most encouraging recent Supreme Court decision along these lines was <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Plata\">Brown v. Plata</a></em>, a 5-4 ruling in 2011 upholding a lower court order that California release tens of thousands of prisoners to reduce overcrowding, which the state itself admitted was unconstitutional. It was, Simon notes, \"the first prisoners' rights decision to come down in favor of the prisoner in a long time. It ended mass incarceration in California.\" But the unique circumstances of the case meant it had limited applicability outside the state.</p>\n<p id=\"cPLOoC\">In the past, the Court hasn't been particularly willing to accept Eighth Amendment challenges to prison conditions. In <em>Rhodes v. Chapman</em>, an 8-1 decision in 1981, the Court ruled that \"double celling\" (placing two inmates in a space with room for only one) was not cruel and unusual punishment. That effectively ruled out Eighth Amendment challenges to overcrowding in and of itself.</p>\n<p id=\"vd2ZRb\">Overturning <em>Rhodes</em> seems unlikely, but modifying it with a ruling specifying that people who are seriously ill need better treatment could be possible. And because prisons are, like the country as a whole, aging considerably at the moment, that could have a far-reaching impact.</p>\n<p id=\"DvfVa9\">\"The new focus of prison conditions, which could be a real game changer in my view, is the intersection of overcrowding with mental and physical health burdens. The real game changer in terms of the current prison population is how disease-burdened it is,\" Simon says. \"That could be pretty far-reaching because states have to contemplate the consequence of incarcerating so many aging prisoners.\"</p>\n<p id=\"GvV7pJ\">Dolovich also emphasizes the need to expand prisoners’ procedural ability to challenge their conditions. The 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act greatly limited prisoners' access to the courts for making complaints about conditions, and the Court could either interpret the law in ways that minimize those limits (as it did in <em><a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ross-v-blake/\">Ross v. Blake</a></em> this year) or attempt to strike down provisions of the act. That opens the door to more challenges, including challenges focusing on the intersection of overcrowding and poor prisoner health.</p>\n<p id=\"EHAF9o\">\"If you require prisons to be constitutional in this way, it becomes more expensive and burdensome for states to comply,\" Dolovich explains. \"States are going to reduce the incarceration rate.\"</p>\n<p id=\"UtBBxY\">One way in which the courts could be more receptive to directly challenging sentences, she says, is by starting to take <a href=\"http://www.abacollateralconsequences.org/user_guide/\">\"collateral consequences\"</a> into account. That’s the technical term for the myriad ways that criminal convictions, and in particular sex crime convictions, can hamper defendants’ lives in the long term. That includes restrictions on where they can live after they’re released from prison, bans on government employment and benefits like public housing, inclusion on sex offender registries, bans on gun purchases and voting, and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"BlosOE\">Dolovich outlined one possible example of a challenge incorporating collateral consequences: \"So you’re a 19-year-old boy who’s been convicted of having sex with your 15-year-old girlfriend. You’re convicted of statutory rape, which itself carries huge direct carceral consequences — you go to prison for five years. But not only that; you also have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life, which is a burden in itself and carries innumerable other collateral consequences that come along with the status of being a registered sex offender.\"</p>\n<p id=\"Rq9by9\">\"So you bring a claim under <em>Harmelin v. Michigan</em>\" — a 1991 ruling banning \"grossly disproportionate\" sentences — \"claiming the sentence you received is grossly disproportionate to the crime. That’s an incredibly state-friendly standard, and you barely ever win. … But  a court committed to including collateral consequences in its thinking about gross disproportionality would realize it’s not just the five years in prison, it’s all of the burdens that someone registered as a sex offender has to follow.\"</p>\n<a id=\"deathpenalty\"></a>\n<h3>The death penalty could be ripe for another challenge</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"execution chamber\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RGt0kr220xl8SloT7rfxGwGVjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2648668/1445502.0.jpg\">\n      <cite>Per-Anders Pettersson/Liaison</cite>\n      <figcaption>An execution bed in Texas.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"hhZhCX\">Almost as explosive as Kennedy's 2015 concurrence was a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-7955_aplc.pdf\">dissent filed by Stephen Breyer and joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> that same year. The case, <em>Glossip v. Gross</em>, resulted in a 5-4 ruling affirming that the particular drug cocktail Oklahoma currently uses in executions doesn't violate the Eighth Amendment. One dissent, by Sonia Sotomayor and joined by the Court's other three liberals, narrowly argued against the specific drugs. Breyer's dissent took aim at capital punishment as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"N7O5lT\">\"The death penalty, in and of itself, now likely constitutes a legally prohibited ‘cruel and unusual punishment,’\" Breyer concluded. He rests the argument on four premises: a) the Court has ruled that death sentences must be reliably applied only to appropriate cases to be constitutional, and the frequency of wrongful executions shows that the punishment is not reliably applied; b) the punishment is arbitrarily applied, with some \"worst of the worst\" offenders not receiving it and some lesser offenders facing execution; c) wait times between conviction and execution are cruelly long; and d) the decline in the punishment’s usage in the US shows it’s becoming unconstitutionally \"unusual.\"</p>\n<p id=\"wEzFoE\">It’s telling that neither Sotomayor nor Elena Kagan, the two other liberals on the Court, joined Breyer’s opinion. And it’s hard to imagine Merrick Garland, who was one of the prosecutors who successfully sought to see Timothy McVeigh executed, declaring his own past actions categorically unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"Q4bHug\">But if Garland’s nomination fails and Clinton picks a less tough-on-crime nominee for Scalia’s seat, or if Kennedy leaves the Court during her presidency, it’s conceivable there would exist five votes for outright abolition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"tgHQQa\">\"I would not be surprised to see Sotomayor and Kagan supportive of [abolishing the death penalty],\" Simon says. \"Kennedy is a harder call. The reason I'm somewhat optimistic about including Kennedy goes back to his interest in dignity. The strongest of the opinions in <em>Furman\" — </em>the 1972 case that briefly abolished capital punishment — \"was William Brennan's, and Brennan based it most directly on human dignity. He argued the Eighth Amendment bans any punishment you can't carry out without respecting the dignity of those being punished.\" Kennedy leaned heavily on the importance of dignity in <em>Brown v. Plata</em>, the California prison overcrowding case.</p>\n<p id=\"SxdDs6\">Simon even found an early Kennedy opinion from when he was a circuit court judge in the 1970s in which he quoted Brennan’s concurrence in <em>Furman</em> at length. Even if Kennedy doesn’t buy a dignity argument for abolishing the death penalty, Simon suspects he’d be swayed by the issue of delays, which Breyer raised — and which were the entire reason for the prisoner’s stay in solitary confinement that Kennedy assailed in his concurrence last year.</p>\n<p id=\"XcpMdd\">\"[Kennedy] came and gave a talk at Berkeley Law about a year and a half ago, and one of my colleagues was rude enough to ask him point blank whether he thought the death penalty was compatible with human dignity,\" Simon recalls. \"Of course he declined to answer, but he said kind of cryptically, ‘Here in California you guys take so long enough to execute people that we may not even need to reach that cliff.’\"</p>\n<p id=\"Zm8O8B\">One other death penalty–related case Simon thinks the Court could amend or overturn, which could have widespread implication outside this specific issue area, is <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCleskey_v._Kemp\">McCleskey v. Kemp</a></em>, a 1987 case in which the Court ruled 5-4 that a death sentence for a black defendant could not be overturned due to the state of Georgia's hugely disproportionate imposition of capital punishment on African Americans.</p>\n<p>The effect of that was to foreclose challenges to the criminal justice system premised on its discriminatory <em>effect</em> — the Court required that plaintiffs show that discrimination was <em>intended</em>, not merely that the system was in effect discriminating against African Americans.</p>\n<p id=\"Y4XSou\">\"It's been terrible for equal protection law generally. Criminal justice is run through with very disproportionate racial practices that are very difficult to prove as discrimination,\" Simon says. \"Overturning <em>McCleskey</em>, and a <a href=\"http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol8_no5_6/art7.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">companion case</a> a few years later, could be a really important change agent both in unleashing the potential for trial court challenges to racially disproportionate criminal justice practices of all sorts, and perhaps ending the death penalty in those states where it seems most firmly rooted, like Texas and Florida.\"</p>\n<a id=\"citizensunited\"></a>\n<h3>The Court probably won’t overturn, but could limit,&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em>\n</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Campaign Finance protest, citizens united\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6F264Gxt4JZ_tSltI95293yRLgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/5896527/CF_Protest.0.jpg\">\n      <cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>A protest on the fifth anniversary of <em>Citizens United.</em>\n</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"Tdhqn1\">No Supreme Court action in recent memory has provoked the kind of populist outcry and fury of <em>Citizens United v.

The Court rarely reverses rulings explicitly, especially ones made as recently as <em>Citizens United</em>. And more to the point, <em>directly</em> overruling the decision would likely entail a challenge to a campaign finance law identical or very similar to the one at issue in the case. Congress shows little interest in passing such a law, and states similarly lack initiative to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"P8531P\">That being said, the legal scholars I asked suggested that a more left-leaning Court could subtly undermine <em>Citizens United</em> by upholding distinct campaign finance regulations at the federal and state levels.</p>\n<p id=\"kGCEHl\">\"My guess is that [a more liberal court] wouldn't overrule <em>Citizens United</em> in the short run, but that it would narrow the decision and uphold a range of possible regulations of money in the political process,\" Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago and specialist in free speech cases, says. \"Over time, these decisions would significantly erode <em>Citizens United</em>.\"</p>\n<p id=\"TZOO8S\">Heather Gerken, a Yale Law professor and expert on law surrounding elections, voting, and federalism, concurs, and suggests one possible line of legal reasoning that cases like this could embrace. \"I think <em>Citizens United</em> can be overturned without even overturning it, something that should appeal to a moderate and careful judge like Judge Garland,\" she explains. \"<em>Citizens United</em> was premised on the idea that independent spending was genuinely independent.  If this political cycle has shown us anything, it’s that this premise is flatly wrong … The Court could easily take notice of these facts and license legislators to regulate this spending precisely because it isn’t ‘independent’ in the sense that <i>Citizens United</i> used that term.\"</p>\n<p id=\"Sw5iIF\">This could greenlight limitations on independent corporate spending of the kind that <em>Citizens United</em> struck down without undermining that decision’s reasoning. That prevents the kind of upheaval in precedent that the Court normally tries to avoid, while still signaling to states and Congress that it’s okay to pursue more aggressive campaign finance regulations.</p>\n<a id=\"voting\"></a>\n<h3>The Court could take a more expansive view of voting rights</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"People voting.\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntdbyJIM2Q8d9-rA6k4acjRBiwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945004/GettyImages-155682075.jpg\">\n      <cite><p>Frederic Brown/AFP via Getty Images</p></cite>\n      <figcaption>Voting!</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"GIEsge\">While less popularly reviled than <em>Citizens United</em>, the Roberts Court’s 2013 decision in <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/voting-rights-fight-explained/what-was-shelby-county-v-holder\"><i>Shelby County v. Holder</i></a><em> </em>was arguably more consequential. The decision struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which contained a formula for deciding which states and counties would have to be subject to \"preclearance,\" a process in which any changes to voting laws they proposed must be run past the Justice Department to make sure they don’t violate the voting rights of minorities.</p>\n<p id=\"F5vGCu\">The upshot of the ruling was that the Voting Rights Act could not be easily enforced by the federal government, and instead has to be enforced through individual lawsuits filed after laws are passed, under Section 2 of the act. That’s a much slower, more expensive process that effectively makes it harder to challenge things like voter ID requirements or restrictions on early voting.</p>\n<p id=\"cHXBgH\">This is something that’s mainly in Congress’s court. \"There are plenty of ways that Congress could revive [preclearance], and a Court with a liberal majority would be far more welcoming to new legislation,\" Gerken says. \"But, again, the ball is in Congress’s court.\"</p>\n<p id=\"QnrQqf\">\"The preclearance regime can't easily be recovered,\" says Pam Karlan, a law professor at Stanford and former deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights specializing in voting rights. At best, she explains, \"the Supreme Court could give a robust reading of Section 2 in the Voting Rights Act,\" and use it to invalidate large categories of franchise-restricting voting regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"0jhqyM\">The problem is deeper than <em>Shelby</em>, too. \"The Court has really moved to an ‘undue burden’ standard on the right to vote\" in the past 10 years or so, Karlan explains, \"rather than treating it as a straightforward fundamental rights issue under strict scrutiny.\"</p>\n<p id=\"Tuawxd\">Under an undue burden standard, legislation that places some burden on a constitutional right, such as the right to vote, is acceptable, as long as that burden isn't excessive in scale.</p>\n<p>For example, in <em><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-21.pdf\">Crawford v. Marion County</a></em> in 2008, the Court ruled that Indiana's photo ID requirement for voters was not an undue burden, because, as Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, \"the inconvenience of going to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters' right to vote.\"</p>\n<p id=\"NzPQrN\">\"Strict scrutiny,\" by contrast, is the toughest test a law can face in court, requiring that it address a government interest that's really compelling, and address it in the least restrictive, narrowest way possible. Voter ID laws would be in trouble with such a regime, not least since the evidence that voter fraud is a major problem, and preventing it is a compelling government interest, is basically nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"nrUbjS\">But Karlan notes that the Court wouldn’t even have to totally reverse course and start applying strict scrutiny to make progress on these issues. \"One of the things I’ve been thinking about is a more liberal version of the undue burden–style standards that the Court has employed,\" she says. \"A version of that test that really takes into account socioeconomic disparities and the like could have a major impact.\"</p>\n<p id=\"jD8ejB\">\"For example, voter ID — it’s not a burden on most people to have a voter ID,\" she continues. \"A huge majority of Americans drive cars and have drivers' licenses. So saying that you need to show your driver’s license to vote for most people is not a burden. But if there’s a group of people that are too poor to own cars, or are disabled in ways that mean they can't drive, for those people getting the documents and going to the DMV and dealing with a system that requires a certain degree of sophistication is a real burden. If courts were to start taking seriously the question of looking at the burden with respect to the people who actually face it, that might change dramatically how the Court thinks about a lot of these issues.\"</p>\n<p id=\"tJ7g2L\">That’s a particularly promising avenue for the Court since it requires minimal change in the Court’s doctrines. \"It’s not necessarily the legal tests themselves that are the problem,\" Karlan notes. \"It’s the sensibilities and the understandings and the world-awareness of the people applying the tests.\" That’s something that changing the membership of the Court could shift substantially, even if the new Court isn’t eager to overturn precedent.</p>\n<a id=\"gerrymandering\"></a>\n<h3>The Court could start to fight gerrymandering</h3>\n<div id=\"BRsg9p\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.vox.com/videos/iframe?id=78322\" frameborder=\"0\" seamless=\"true\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" name=\"78322-chorus-video-iframe\"></iframe></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p id=\"JWt1pC\">Both Karlan and Gerken also point to gerrymandering and districting issues as an area where action from a more liberal Court would be likely.</p>\n<p id=\"xWpReL\">As it stands, many judicial conservatives view partisan gerrymandering issues as \"non-justiciable.\" The Court has agreed to no firm standard as to what is and isn’t allowed in creating congressional and legislative districts, and in 2004’s <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer\">Vieth v. Jubelirer</a></em> a plurality opinion by the right wing of the Court argued that no such standard is even possible.</p>\n<p id=\"q8OQ4l\">But the Court’s four liberals dissented, and Anthony Kennedy filed a concurrence arguing that while at that moment there was no clear standard the Court could use to evaluate whether a redistricting is acceptable, it’s possible the Court could develop such a standard in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"4WumkX\">Since then, there’s been a lot of academic energy around trying to develop such a standard. <a href=\"https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/82_2/04%20Stephanopoulos_McGhee_ART.pdf\">University of Chicago law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos and political scientist Eric McGhee</a> have devised one promising option, which notes that gerrymandering forces the losing party to \"waste\" votes by placing all its voters into a small number of districts where the party gets a landslide, rather than spreading those voters out so they can have more impact.</p>\n<p id=\"XZX4LC\">Stephanopoulos and McGhee argue that fair districting requires a roughly equal number of wasted votes for each party, and that districting schemes where one party is wasting many more votes are unconstitutional.  <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/understanding-wisconsin-s-legislative-redistricting-trial-the-efficiency-gap-partisan/article_dd107d13-684f-5306-a680-43923fec7027.html\"><em>Whitford v. Nichol</em></a>, a challenge to Wisconsin's gerrymandering for state House districts, is using the Stephanopolous and McGhee standard, and could eventually make it to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"IZkOEw\">But there are other standards on offer as well, including one developed by political scientists <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/jp-abs.shtml\">Gary King and Bernard Grofman</a> of Harvard and UC Irvine, respectively, and another by <a href=\"http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/06/3_-_Wang_-_Stan._L._Rev.pdf\">Princeton neuroscientist Sam Wang</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"RFWany\">\"I do think this will be a Court open to the possibility of policing partisan gerrymanders, at least the worst ones,\" Gerken says. \"I’ve told every election lawyer and social scientist I know to dust off their old papers and briefs, because I think the Court is ready to act.  It just needs a manageable standard to move forward, and there are plenty of those.\"</p>\n<p id=\"OcJqFn\">\"The question can’t be, ‘Was there any gerrymandering here?’\" Karlan notes. \"If the people who drew the districts are breathing, there was some level of gerrymandering, particularly if they’re drawn by state legislatures. The question has to be, ‘Is it too much?'\"</p>\n<a id=\"abortion\"></a>\n<h3>How abortion law could change</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Protesters during Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt oral arguments at the Supreme Court.\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8FrTwGqchgT6mJjPmzGDRVYiO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6966341/GettyImages-513327920.jpg\">\n      <cite>Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Protesters during <em>Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt</em> oral arguments at the Supreme Court.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"qLCkXo\">This past spring saw the strongest Supreme Court verdict affirming reproductive rights in years, as the Court struck down two Texas regulations of abortion clinics in <em><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/11713644/whole-womans-health-supreme-court-choice\">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a></em><em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"OkIHLt\">One interesting aspect of the Court’s ruling is that Stephen Breyer, the author of the majority opinion, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf\">explicitly invoked an \"undue burden\" test</a>. As in voting rights, the Court has decided to evaluate abortion regulations under that metric, rather than treating abortion as a fundamental right that the Court must past a strict test to restrict.</p>\n<p id=\"firstHeading\">In 1992's <i>Planned Parenthod v. Casey</i> decision, a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/cover_story/2016/03/how_the_undue_burden_concept_eroded_roe_v_wade.html\">plurality opinion by Sandra Day O'Connor embraced the \"undue burden,\" standard</a>, which has had the effect of allowing a wide number of abortion regulations — bans on late-term abortions, parental consent requirements, waiting periods — that otherwise would’ve been struck down.</p>\n<p id=\"RhVqf6\">Indeed, not even a decade earlier, in <em>City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health</em>, the Court struck down a waiting period and parental consent requirement and explicitly rejected an argument from O’Connor in the dissent, and from the Reagan administration’s solicitor general, Rex Lee, that they should adopt an undue burden standard that would allow such measures. Once undue burden was adopted, those kinds of provisions were viable for states to pass again.</p>\n<p id=\"Kl5i88\"><em>Whole Woman’s Health</em> didn’t abandon the undue burden standard but instead repurposed it, in much the way Karlan suggested, by taking into account things like indirect effects (the closure of clinics due to the regulations, for example) and effects on quality of care and the patient experience of women seeking abortions. A test that had formerly been used to restrict the right to abortion had been retrofitted to protect it.</p>\n<p id=\"hW9yzc\">\"It is difficult to say, but my guess is that undue burden will remain the standard going forward, with the focus on exactly how it will be applied, because it is a standard that can be developed to apply to strongly protect against harmful government restrictions on abortion,\" Dawn Johnsen, an expert on abortion law and a professor of law at Indiana University, says.</p>\n<p id=\"8wyV1d\">If the Court wanted to make a bigger shift on the issue, it could adopt an argument that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/20/opinion/oe-sunstein20\">Justice Ginsburg</a> has been making for years and start considering abortion as an <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/to-have-and-to-hold\">issue of gender equality</a>. <em>Roe v. Wade </em>asserted a right to abortion based on a right to privacy found in the due process clause of the 14th Amendment; many observers have argued this is a flimsy basis for the right to abortion, and that premising it on the equal protection clause, and arguing that restrictions on abortion unconstitutionally burden women without affecting men, would make for a firmer foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"JLxVvf\">In particular, this reevaluation could lead to increased abortion access for poor women. In a number of states, including Connecticut, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Alaska, state constitutional guarantees to equal protection have been used to <a href=\"http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/Wharton.pdf\">mandate that Medicaid cover medically necessary abortions</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"XrStqP\">It’s unlikely that the Court will overturn <em>Harris v. McRae</em>, a 1980 case upholding the Hyde Amendment, Congress’s ban on most federal funding for Medicaid abortions, anytime soon. But an equal protection reevaluation of abortion rights is at least somewhat likely, and could lay the groundwork for a right to abortion coverage in the medium to long run.</p>\n<p id=\"yOqDit\">\"​Supreme Court justices increasingly over the years have recognized that the right to choose when and whether to bear children is important not just to their individual liberty but to women's equality,\" Johnsen says. \"I think odds are very good that a majority of justices in the future will hold that the right is protected by the constitutional right to both liberty and equal protection.\"</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<h3>And that’s just the start</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Clarence Gideon\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJfmU3BSUIZasrYJ1pgrVbf1Zug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6966539/Clarence_Earl_Gideon.jpg\">\n      <cite><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clarence_Earl_Gideon.jpg\">Unknown</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>Clarence Gideon, the namesake of the decision creating a right to state-provided counsel in criminal cases.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"nRkGJm\">Even outside the issues of imprisonment, capital punishment, elections, gerrymandering, and abortion, there are places where the Court could move. Karlan raises the possibility of a <a href=\"http://civilrighttocounsel.org/\">\"civil </a><em><a href=\"http://civilrighttocounsel.org/\">Gideon\"</a></em><em> — </em>a ruling that would create a right to counsel in civil cases, so poor people are guaranteed a lawyer if they need to sue their landlord or their employer; the name comes from <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>, which established the right to a government-provided attorney in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"IP98rm\">Hailly Korman, a principal at Bellwether Education Partners and a veteran education attorney, expresses hope that the Court could overturn <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</em>, the 1973 decision that concluded, 5-4, that there was no federal right to education.</p>\n<p>\"With a liberal majority, I don't think it's implausible,\" Korman explains. \" I think there is a very strong case to be made that some minimum of education is a necessary prerequisite to enable people to access and wield all of their other rights. If I could change one thing about our federal jurisprudence, this would be it.\"</p>\n<p id=\"sU56f8\">Berkeley’s Simon notes that a more liberal Court could push back on past Court decisions about policing expanding the scope of searches and seizures — like <em>Whren v. United States</em>, which Simon alleges \"constitutionalized racial profiling\" by letting police stop cars whenever they want as long as there's probable cause for a traffic violation; or <em>Atwater v. City of Lago Vista</em>, which held that police could arrest people and take them for jail for driving without a seat belt, a crime that can't be punished with jail or prison time — and thus send a signal to police to use less aggressive techniques, particularly in policing communities of color.</p>\n<p id=\"D66AhW\">David Strauss, a professor at University of Chicago Law School, argues that focusing on classic Supreme Court issues that split on liberal/conservative lines (like abortion) distracts from areas of law that might prove to be bigger parts of the Court's jurisprudence, like \"the relationship between free speech and both government secrets and individual privacy,\" and cyber harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"tu6wl9\">But even if a small fraction of the changes detailed above are incorporated into a new, more liberal Court’s jurisprudence, the consequences could be momentous. The Scalia vacancy and Kennedy’s coming exit have opened the door for liberals to rethink American law in dramatic ways, the implications of which are only beginning to be teased out.</p>\n</div>\n<ul data-analytics-placement=\"bottom\" class=\"m-related-links clearfix\">\n<h3>Learn more</h3>\n<li class=\"related-links-item\"><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/28/12045768/supreme-court-term-winners-losers\" class=\"related-links-link\" data-analytics-link=\"related\">\n<div style=\"background-image: url( https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rgwj5hSvu3pY3vWIdvWZGkSakkU=/0x164:3000x1831/1080x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49977349/GettyImages-543299172.0.jpg );\" class=\"related-links-item-image\"></div>\n<div class=\"related-links-item-highlight\"></div>\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"related-links-item-headline\">5 winners and 4 losers from this Supreme Court term</div>\n</a></li>\n<li class=\"related-links-item\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/a/trump-tax\" class=\"related-links-link\" data-analytics-link=\"related\">\n<div style=\"background-image: url( https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6952499/facebook.0.png );\" class=\"related-links-item-image\"></div>\n<div class=\"related-links-item-highlight\"></div>\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"related-links-item-headline\">The Trump Tax: A daily number showing how Trump is blowing the election for the GOP</div>\n</a></li>\n<li class=\"related-links-item\"><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8913297/mass-incarceration-maps-charts\" class=\"related-links-link\" data-analytics-link=\"related\">\n<div style=\"background-image: url( https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_DqImRvF7aOJyoSQfq02tIqL-4A=/0x285:5184x3165/1080x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46707374/GettyImages-171666554.0.jpg );\" class=\"related-links-item-image\"></div>\n<div class=\"related-links-item-highlight\"></div>\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"related-links-item-headline\">How America became the world's leader in incarceration, in 22 maps and charts</div>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004ab0ca8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002cbce90 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12484000/supreme-court-liberal-clinton">, @published=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry::Published:0x00000002cb5938 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002cbce90 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 08:00:03 -0400>, @rights=nil, @source=nil, @summary=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000002cac248 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002cbce90 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="How the first liberal Supreme Court in a generation could reshape America">, @updated=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Updated:0x00000002cb0ac8 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002cbce90 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content=2016-08-22 08:00:03 -0400>, @author=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000004adf5d0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002cbce90 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @name=#<RSS::Atom::PersonConstruct::Name:0x00000004ade298 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Author:0x00000004adf5d0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="Dylan Matthews">, @uri=nil, @email=nil>], @category=[], @contributor=[], @link=[#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Link:0x00000004ab2008 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000002cbce90 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @href="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12484000/supreme-court-liberal-clinton", @rel="alternate", @type="text/html", @hreflang=nil, @title=nil, @length=nil>], @dc_title=[], @dc_description=[], @dc_creator=[], @dc_subject=[], @dc_publisher=[], @dc_contributor=[], @dc_type=[], @dc_format=[], @dc_identifier=[], @dc_source=[], @dc_language=[], @dc_relation=[], @dc_coverage=[], @dc_rights=[], @dc_date=[]>, #<RSS::Atom::Feed::Entry:0x00000004adc420 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 @parent=nil, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang="en", @base=nil, @generator=nil, @icon=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Icon:0x00000004a9bdd0 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png">, @id=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Id:0x00000004aa7f40 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @content="http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml">, @logo=nil, @rights=nil, @subtitle=nil, @title=#<RSS::Atom::Feed::Title:0x00000003b32448 @parent=#<RSS::Atom::Feed:0x00000003bbc2b0 ...>, @converter=nil, @do_validate=false, @lang=nil, @base=nil, @type=nil, @xhtml=nil, @content="Vox -

She’s just endured her own round of disappointments — largely stemming from another teacher dumping her in humiliating fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"Av3tjU\">And in that moment, she reaches over and takes Neal’s hand, even though in an earlier episode, she had told him, in no uncertain terms, that she didn’t think very much of him.</p>\n\n<div class=\"chorus-snippet s-related\" data-analytics-action=\"link:related\" data-analytics-category=\"article\">\n<span class=\"s-related__title\">Related</span>  <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/5/12383116/vice-principals-danny-mcbride-hbo-interview-review\">Vice Principals' Danny McBride on how his polarizing new HBO comedy captures the national mood.

She had plenty of insights into her character, yes, but she also offered me her take on what she — a Brit — learned about Americans and our school system by spending seven months playing an American high school teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"oq6Chd\"><i>Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"YNzPgv\">On why Snodgrass does what she does: \"Her compassion and empathy is huge, as well as her insecurity\"</h3>\n<div class=\"align-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Vice Principals\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/62fpRZxwSfLn2uIVL4oLwPj9WIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6973215/vicegeorgiaking.jpg\">\n      <cite>HBO</cite>\n      <figcaption>Georgia King stars in Vice Principals.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"wP0Y1Z\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"iQvTe0\">So Amanda reaches out and takes Neal’s hand at the end of this episode. What was your read on why she does that?</p>\n<h3 id=\"fEhBQK\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"QTvPeZ\">As the love interest, it was very important for me to find if they do connect, why do they connect? Ground it in something very real and meaningful, so it doesn't just become, \"Oh well, we have to move the story on, so they'll just happen to like each other.\" I really wanted to understand from Snodgrass why Gamby touches her, emotionally.</p>\n<p id=\"OrVXIx\">I think her compassion and empathy is huge, as well as her insecurity. She's very generous to other people. Even at the beginning of the show, before she's romantically interested in Neal, I think she's keen to get on with him. She kind of tries to absorb this very strange human being. She's not a polished human being. She doesn't have the best communication skills herself, just like Gamby doesn't.</p>\n<p id=\"aEyU4B\">The sixth episode, it's a really special episode for me. That's a very important episode to understand really just how much Gamby is struggling. And Snodgrass sees this man fully. I think a lot of people see the blowhard side of him, the angry side, and Snodgrass sees the vulnerability, the anxieties, the self-doubt. And she believes in him, sees the good as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5YMe08\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"6GofdU\">That’s a pretty big change, though, from where she is in episode three, where she’s pretty honest with Neal and tells him that he’s ruining the school trip they’re on. You say that by episode six, she can see the real him. What were the moments where you think that happened?</p>\n<h3 id=\"seZhjL\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"GO9ERQ\">[Episode three] is a huge turning point for Snodgrass.</p>\n<p id=\"Zsjh9K\">Not only does she mess up and try to confront [Gamby] and do it all wrong, but she actually just pushes him further away. I think she prides herself in being fully equipped and ready for school, and then she just isn't as good as she thinks she is. It's not just like the school is crazy for her, and she's trying to navigate her way through. I think she's not as good as she was hoping to be, and it's a tough challenge for her.</p>\n<div class=\"float-left\"></div>\n<p id=\"adEvko\">By making a mistake, she sees somebody directly that she hurts, and then the big turning point for her is seeing [Gamby] at the end of episode three talking about his daughter. That's a revelation: That Gamby wants to be a good father.</p>\n<p id=\"Y5Ilqq\">That piques her interest at the end of three. So she probably sees more of how wrongly people are perceiving Gamby and how wrongly he's putting himself out there in the world. I think she still continues to see the hard edge to Neal Gamby, but she knows of the soft. I think six is a really big episode for her to show herself and her pain, as well as seeing his.</p>\n<h3 id=\"UFwJ2M\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"m6cClR\">Six is also the first real glimpse we get of her personal life. I like the way <i><a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/vice-principals\">Vice Principals</a></i><i> </i>lets you think you know a character, then pulls back and reveals they have this whole other life outside of school. What did you find most surprising about Snodgrass’s life?</p>\n<h3 id=\"pkmR7O\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"za27RP\">It was so cool when I read that episode, because I was, like, \"Oh my goodness, okay, this woman does not have her shit together. She does not have her life the way that she wants it.\" It was a huge revelation for me.</p>\n<p id=\"U6kMg7\">I remember reading that cold open with her being so crudely dumped, and that rejection hurts her in a way that comes out of nowhere. She tries to do what I think a lot of women feel we need to do, which is to try to come across as being cool and in control, and really she's not. It's a very painful breakup.</p>\n<p id=\"Xl9T8B\">I love seeing that in a character, where they try to present one thing, when really something else is going on, and you have that great pull and tug between reality and hopes of putting something else out into the world, an image of who you are. We all want to show the world this side of us, but actually we have these very terrified sad times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"IQ8o6d\">On learning about America: \"It’s funny how you start melting into another culture\"</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"2016 Summer TCA Tour - Day 4\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hq-Je4npb3Pq8l7VPblaVf3aU3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6973221/584702272.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Georgia King and Walton Goggins appear at the Television Critics Association summer press tour session for Vice Principals.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"bsVxQH\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"XH60PG\">You’re not from an American small town, but you filmed <i>Vice Principals</i> in South Carolina. What did you think of that sort of American small town way of life? What did you learn about America from that?</p>\n<h3 id=\"VG5U0Z\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"ixDIK5\">The first thing I'll do with a character is figure out where I can understand them and where I can align a lot of my own experiences and battles and whatnot with them, and if they're different, how I can embrace the differences.</p>\n<p id=\"BOsAbt\">There are a lot of traits about [this character’s] personality that I recognize. I'm not from a small town in America. I'm from a small middle-of-nowhere village in the countryside in England.</p>\n<p id=\"uibgeH\">And I went to a [US] school [to do research for this role], because obviously the school system is very different as well. I interviewed a teacher on a broader scale in terms of differences between England and American education, but also on a personal level, like what are the things that happen within the school environment as a teacher.</p>\n<div class=\"float-right\"></div>\n<p id=\"zDunVK\">Because I was improvising with [the cast] and wanted to feel entirely free as this character and not let the Britishness of me get in the way, I just got rid of it. I just was an American for at least two months leading up to the show, which at first felt silly, especially with friends who know you very well for who you are. Your identity is so much in how you speak, so to manage to get rid of that and lose the Georgia that I've known for however long and be an American me really helped.</p>\n<p id=\"3935PP\">It's funny how you start melting into another culture and you start feeling more unified and cohesive. It probably sounds a bit creepy but it really made a huge difference for me, and I actually didn't speak \"in British\" on set for at least the first season. I think the crew were all looking at me funny when I did finally break and spoke [with my British accent].</p>\n<p id=\"qKUknZ\">For me, it was very important I did play American versus British. When I was filming, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324658/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Walton [Goggins’s]</a> wife asked me, \"Why didn't they just make her British for you?\" But I love that the thing that defines Snodgrass and makes her stand out for Neal Gamby's character isn't a foreignness and a mystique. She's just one of the crew in that show. She's one of the gang. What defines her and makes her unique for him is to do with her personality versus the way she sounds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3xUt2z\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"7S2fvJ\">What about the American education system most surprised you, compared to how you were raised?</p>\n<h3 id=\"UxOoQd\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"s5DO7l\">What really shocked me was the technology side of things.</p>\n<div class=\"float-left\"></div>\n<p>Maybe this is to do with age, rather than cultural stuff, but the teacher I interviewed was telling me how the kids aren't allowed to take pictures of the board for notes until at the end of class.</p>\n<p id=\"0kvbgh\">I was, like, \"What do you mean, take pictures? Where are their journals and their notebooks and their pencils and pens?\" The introduction of iPads and technology was really surprising to me, it really surprised me that to freehand write is not just a given thing you do every day till your hands hurt. I still have a bump on my finger from writing at school.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Kr2siY\">On Amanda Snodgrass herself: \"Her biggest flaw is having an idea of where she’ll be and not finding herself there\"</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Vice Principals\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxvpoWKKXfsVuv9LdMkdm8oeYZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6973491/vicesnodgam.png\">\n      <cite>HBO</cite>\n      <figcaption>Amanda and Neal look for a gift for Neal’s daughter.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"ORTEFJ\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"brvGTh\">What drew you to the role of Amanda Snodgrass and made <i>Vice Principals</i> a show you wanted to be involved in?</p>\n<h3 id=\"yfhvCP\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"AmbeQy\">I was given the first two episodes, and Snodgrass is in them, but not as much as she is in the following episodes. It really was the tone of the actual show that just struck me as something so unusual and funny and delightful and dark and gleeful, but also painful and vulnerable. It was by far some of the most extraordinary two scripts I'd read.</p>\n<p id=\"pI5ZTd\">I was really intrigued by the whole story rather than just my character, and then was overwhelmed and thrilled that my character becomes who she is in the show, to then go, \"Oh wow, my character is full of complexities, and there's a lot of darkness and vulnerability in her, and it's not quite what it seems at the beginning.\"</p>\n<p id=\"GC9WFG\">That's a real gift to get a role that's complex and has depth and has some really ugly flaws as well. These guys do that so well. They present real people who have a full spectrum of qualities and strange traits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"xmrEaN\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"dHz44f\">You’ve mentioned Snodgrass’s flaws a few times now. What do you think is her biggest flaw? What can’t she get right?</p>\n<h3 id=\"1staFO\">Georgia King</h3>\n<div class=\"float-right\"></div>\n<p id=\"lS7NeQ\">She has expectations of what she thinks her life is going to be and what she thinks her career as teacher is going to be versus the reality that she finds herself in. Her biggest flaw is having an idea of where she'll be and not finding herself there, and instead finding herself in a very lonely place.</p>\n<p id=\"m7ylby\">I think she's an incredibly lonely woman who is struggling with connections and romance and finding a partner, and I think she gets a little mixed up and lost. When people treat her badly, she doesn't know better than to brush that aside and put it on them, she takes that as a comment on who she is.</p>\n<p id=\"eqTgm2\">She’s an incredibly insecure woman who's definitely lost, I'd say is the clearest way of putting it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"qSanZ8\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"0HZ3sT\">So much of <i>Vice Principals</i><b> </b>is about anger and frustration, but we don’t really see Snodgrass have an outburst of rage or anything, at least so far. Do you feel like she has those moments? Or is she keeping it all bottled up?</p>\n<h3 id=\"ejZnPU\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"GaXWca\">There actually was a small scene [in episode six]<b> </b>where Snodgrass does lose it that isn't in the cut. The intention for Danny [McBride] and [co-creator/director] <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2095817/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Jody [Hill]</a><b> </b>was to show that she is absolutely capable of having that rage too.</p>\n<p id=\"VNuWVV\">I love the decisions they've made with how they've put this together, and how they've created all these incredible character arcs. I got to have that moment of cathartic anger and release, and I do have moments throughout the show that I get to have that. But I like that the characters all have that, but they express it in different ways.</p>\n<div class=\"float-left\"></div>\n<p id=\"EALBEA\">The choices [McBride and Hill] made in how they edited this show and how they put it together really stays honest to the actual characters themselves. That's why I've had such a kick out of watching it and being a part of this. We actually felt like we knew these people by the end of the shoot. They were real people to us, which is super creepy and maybe just a result of being together for seven months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8PmOh8\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"gGvfVp\">You mentioned Snodgrass trying to put on a brave face after her breakup, and one of the themes of <i>Vice Principals</i> is sort of learning to be okay with your own weakness. As someone who professionally puts on other faces to make a living, what have you learned about dealing with vulnerability in your own life?</p>\n<h3 id=\"fNmrRB\">Georgia King</h3>\n<p id=\"jFjj7x\">I've learned that it's okay to find yourself in a direction that you might not have anticipated. I've learned that it is more healthy, and it isn't weak to be honest about feeling pain and anxieties and vulnerability.</p>\n<p id=\"9uolFf\">Snodgrass reaches out. She needs Gamby as much as he needs her. It's not just about, \"Does the guy get the girl? Does the girl get the guy?\" There's a mutual need and a mutual pull toward each other.</p>\n<p id=\"VdYlT3\">It's a wonderful thing to be able to lean on people. As much as I want to be there for other people, I'm glad that I have people in my life that I can lean on too. Snodgrass feels that too in the show.</p>\n<p id=\"G4NRp9\">Vice Principals <i>airs Sundays at 10:30 pm Eastern </i><i><a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/vice-principals\">on HBO</a></i><i>.

For the 11,000 athletes who participated in the Rio Games, the closing ceremony marks the end of an intense two weeks of competition and the media attention that comes with it.</p>\n<p id=\"8TISEq\">Now they return to their lives away from the spotlight — either to eventually begin training for the Tokyo Games in 2020, or, for athletes who are retiring, to find a new career path.</p>\n<p id=\"fdW38w\">What is it like to go home after the intensity of the Olympics? <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12046050/life-after-the-olympics\">We spoke to eight Olympians</a> about that very question. Here’s what they told us.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1TvkcY\">1) The sting of defeat is especially strong when it’s your last Olympics</h3>\n<p id=\"RA94YI\">When runner <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12077672/olympics-jim-ryun-track\">Jim Ryun</a> tripped and fell in a qualifying race during the 1972 Munich Olympics, he appealed to the officials to reinstate him so he could run in the finals. Their response? \"It's unfortunate what happened to you. Why don't you come back in four years and try again?\"</p>\n<p id=\"iIkA48\">But Ryun couldn’t just come back in four years — he’d already decided that Munich would be his final Olympics: \"I didn’t want to put my family through the pressure <strong></strong> of having to hold a real job in addition to training all those hours. I wasn't going to do that.\"</p>\n<p id=\"rt1zo0\">So he had to live with the fact that at his last Olympics, he didn’t even get a chance to compete for gold.</p>\n<p id=\"Kc621F\">For softball player <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12067548/olympics-jennie-finch\">Jennie Finch</a>, the 2008 Beijing Games were her last Olympics — but not by choice. The International Olympic Committee had voted  to discontinue softball and baseball. So when the US team won silver (the first time in team history that it didn’t win gold), Finch was devastated.</p>\n<p id=\"oLHkfd\">\"To this day, every time I bring out the silver medal, it still stings,\" she said.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ztzpHc\">2) Your mistakes haunt you long after the Olympics are over</h3>\n<p id=\"jcGKXJ\"><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12067592/nick-delpopolo-pot-brownie-olympics\">Nick Delpopolo</a>, a judoka, failed a drug test at the 2012 Olympics after he ate a pot-laced brownie at a going away party. He had to leave London early, and was faced with a barrage of mocking press coverage, including a column in his home state newspaper that said, \"He’ll always be known as the guy who flunked the drug test for pot brownies.\"</p>\n<p id=\"h4AXSq\">Even after the media attention died down, some of his friends and acquaintances wouldn’t let it go:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"fRWmvm\">I lost many sponsors. One was a local athletic club run by people I’d known almost my whole life. Friends, foes, and internet trolls jeered at me for my stupidity. Fellow judokas spread false rumors about me. One even said they saw me doing hard drugs — crystal meth or heroin — at a party. I was frustrated. How did naysayers have the right to take one mistake and spin it into a bigger lie, a smear campaign?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"w1AH6t\">3) Speaking out on controversial issues is risky for Olympic athletes — but worth it</h3>\n<p id=\"MaUcPG\">Runner <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12118332/john-carlos-olympics\">John Carlos</a> raised his fist in protest on the medals podium at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, and paid dearly for it in the days and years that followed. He and Tommie Smith, who also raised his fist, were suspended from the US Olympic team and had to leave Mexico City.</p>\n<p id=\"qJ8m74\">It only got worse from there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people walked away from me. They weren't walking away because they didn't have love for me or they had disdain for me. They were walking away because they were afraid. What they saw happening to me, they didn't want it to happen to them and theirs.</p>\n<p>My wife and kids were tormented. I was strong enough to deal with whatever people threw at me, because this is the life I'd signed up for. But not my family. My marriage crumbled. I got divorced. It was like the Terminator coming and shooting one of his ray guns through my suit of armor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"jBClrO\">Four-time gold medal-winning diver <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12067614/greg-louganis-olympics\">Greg Louganis</a> faced condemnation after he told the world he  was gay and HIV-positive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I went into my press tour wanting to debunk myths about gay people with HIV. Instead, my goals were deflected by commentators who focused on a bad dive at the 1988 Olympics, when I hit the 3-meter springboard, cutting my head open; the wound was treated by a physician, and we didn’t have latex gloves on site in those days. My decision to hide my diagnosis after my injury was called <strong><a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-03-01/sports/1995060179_1_greg-louganis-ebola-hiv\">\"indefensible\"</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1995/02/24/doctor-says-he-treated-louganis-without-gloves-because-of-time/de765b3b-31fe-4896-8336-e13b8ce3c57e/\">\"morally inept.\"</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"vmaPGl\">After years of ostracism from fans and the public at large, both Carlos and Louganis say that the difficulties were worth it. Carlos believes that with so much injustice in the world, people with a public platform must speak out against it.</p>\n<p id=\"ROfPBd\">\"If you're famous and you're black, you have to be an activist,\" he said.</p>\n<p id=\"12aeXf\">Louganis says that he is gratified to know that his story has inspired other athletes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fellow Olympian Ji Wallace, who is gay and HIV-positive, <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfn3mV3YPvQ\">mentioned</a></strong> he went public with his diagnosis after watching one of my interviews with Piers Morgan during the London Olympics. I simply said that HIV doesn’t take over my entire life. It’s just a small part of who I am. I was blown away that my life could give strength to others after all these years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"9O2vn9\">4) Winning gold in one Olympics isn’t a guarantee you’ll make the team for the next Olympics</h3>\n<p id=\"swfIko\"><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12101942/natasha-kai-olympics-soccer\">Natasha Kai</a> was a key player on the gold medal-winning United States women’s soccer team at the 2008 Beijing Games. But by the 2012 London Games, she was off the national team: \"Soccer is a brutally competitive sport. Your place on the national team is always precarious; it's like every day is a new tryout.\"</p>\n<p id=\"PSS4As\">Injuries can also turn the next Olympics from a certainty into an impossibility. After winning silver at the 2004 Athens Games, swimmer <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12099858/olympics-job-maritza-mcclendon\">Maritza McClendon</a> was sure she would be competing for gold in Beijing. But a double shoulder injury dashed those plans. \"I retired, not wanting to be that athlete who strained her body past her prime,\" she said.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HyoIJr\">5) Finding a new career after the Olympics can be a hustle</h3>\n<p id=\"vYLQZe\"><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/13/12067560/olympics-donna-devarona-swimming\">Donna de Varona</a> had won two gold medals in swimming by the time she was 17. But she still couldn’t get a scholarship to swim in college. This was 1964, before Title IX. So de Varona retired from swimming — and then had to figure out what to do with the rest of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"EBZImP\">She decided to talk her way into a job at ABC Sports:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I started thinking about my post-Olympics future, I picked up the phone and called ABC producer Chuck Howard.

It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives </em><em><strong><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/episode-of-the-week\">here</a></strong></em><em>. The episode of the week for August&nbsp;14 through 20 is </em><em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5911282/?ref_=ttep_ep1\">\"Olympics,\"</a></em><em> a special episode </em><em>of NBC’s </em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4477976/\">Superstore</a> <em>made for the Rio Olympics</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"m3726W\">It’s awesome to see that NBC is betting on <em>Superstore</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"0YViRZ\">The half-hour sitcom about a group of employees working at a Walmart-esque big-box store was one of the best surprises to come out of the last TV season. While comedies usually require some time to figure themselves out — something that tends to happen as cast members and writers’ rooms get more comfortable and settle on a show’s tone — <em>Superstore</em> knew what it was almost immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"vC1TeV\">With a sharp cast anchored by star and producer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1065229/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm\">America Ferrera</a>, <em>Superstore</em> quickly slid into an easy rhythm that energized even the simplest stories, including those we’ve seen a hundred times before in other workplace comedies.</p>\n\n<div class=\"chorus-snippet s-related\" data-analytics-action=\"link:related\" data-analytics-category=\"article\">\n<span class=\"s-related__title\">Related</span>  <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/9/10944962/superstore-nbc-review-america-ferrera\">NBC's new sitcom Superstore is quietly having some of the most fun on television</a> \n</div>\n\n<p><span>So it was something of a relief when NBC </span><a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/02/superstore-renewed-season-2-nbc-1201707837/\">renewed </a><em><a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/02/superstore-renewed-season-2-nbc-1201707837/\">Superstore</a></em><em> </em><span>for a second season in February. (The network’s had so much </span><a href=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SmrVEyrdzICGqDnl-DNkcn8UyE4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6886573/TV_FALL_PREVIEW_2015-2.jpg\">trouble getting comedies off the ground</a><span> in recent years that </span><em>The Carmichael Show</em><span> is currently its eldest sitcom, having aired two whole seasons with a third on the way.) And when NBC announced it would be giving </span><em>Superstore</em><span> a primetime slot for a special episode during the Rio Olympics — and that the episode would feature real live Olympians — it was a pleasant surprise.</span></p>\n<p id=\"k4Gse4\">That’s not to say <em>Superstore</em> doesn’t deserve the attention; it earned surprisingly good ratings in its first season without much promotional help, and isn’t so complicated that newcomers would be lost if they just happened to leave the TV on after watching Usain Bolt jet across the finish line. But NBC’s apparent faith in <em>Superstore</em> is a promising sign for a promising comedy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"z5qK9S\">\n<em>Superstore</em> takes cues from <em>The Office</em> to make mundane work entertaining</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CRV2s7zYF6t7-F35ZBdVWtmbHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6972089/amy%20cecily.jpeg\">\n      <cite>NBC</cite>\n      <figcaption>Amy (Ferrera) meets her Olympics idol (Cecily Strong).</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"WAg4mi\"><em>Superstore</em> didn’t go too big for \"Olympics,\" even though it had the advantage of airing in a special time slot at the end of a primetime broadcast of the Rio Olympics that featured the popular 4x100 track and field relay. (The Olympic lead-in <a href=\"http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2016/08/20/tv-ratings-friday-aug-19-2016/\">boosted the show’s ratings</a> far higher than they’ve ever been in the past.)</p>\n<p id=\"v37HMm\">Instead, the episode uses Olympic fever to showcase its characters and style, from Ferrera’s Amy getting heart eyes for a former Olympic gymnast (played by <em>Saturday Night Live</em>’s Cecily Strong) who’s signing books at the store to the store’s well-meaning manager Glenn (Mark McKinney) trying to explain why America is No. 1 forever and always to<strong> </strong>Filipino-American employee Mateo (Nico Santos) realizing he’s an undocumented immigrant.</p>\n<p id=\"jhSArQ\">Also, just about every one of the store’s attempts to celebrate the Olympics ends in hilariously horrifying chaos, which feels about right.</p>\n\n<div data-analytics-category=\"article\" data-analytics-action=\"link:related\" class=\"chorus-snippet s-related\">\n<span class=\"s-related__title\">Related</span>  <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/22/11093900/superstore-nbc-interview-season-finale\">The creator of Superstore on \"will they/won't they\" relationships and hopes for season 2</a> \n</div>\n\n<p><span>After watching \"Olympics,\" it’s hard to believe I ever wondered whether </span><em>Superstore</em><span> could sustain itself, given its fairly simple premise. At first, the idea of a series where every episode took place within the walls of a big-box store seemed limiting.</span></p>\n<p id=\"d8Gxzj\">But <em>Superstore </em>creator <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1541482/\">Justin Spitzer</a> used to be a producer on <em>The Office</em>, which managed to wring 10 seasons’ worth of jokes and emotional beats out of a single Pennsylvanian paper company branch. That show, more than almost any other, knew how to find humor in boredom, a skill that comes in particularly handy on <em>Superstore.</em> Plus, <em>Superstore </em>has the added benefit of having a revolving door of bizarre customers and aisles upon aisles of merchandise to play with, any fraction of which could’ve kept Jim Halpert occupied for years.</p>\n<p id=\"gtLxKc\">There’s also more freedom to experiment. Some of my favorite <em>Superstore</em> jokes are blink-and-you’ll-miss-them interstitial moments between scenes, which show tiny vignettes from around the store, like a customer taking a nap on a display sofa or quietly wreaking havoc in the makeup aisle.</p>\n<p id=\"RDHALR\">In \"Olympics,\" those interstitial moments include speed-skating champion Apolo Anton Ohno trying to get around an older woman who’s swerving her cart, and figure skating gold medalist Tara Lipinski righting herself after <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/sites/nbcunbc/files/files/styles/1080xauto/public/images/2016/8/02/04_NUP_174425_3159.JPG?itok=3oUQcwNy\">almost wiping out</a> on a wet floor.</p>\n<p id=\"wkcmIZ\">True, the interstitials don’t typically feature high-profile former Olympians. But there’s hardly a better example than those unabashedly silly moments of how <em>Superstore</em> can find fun in just about anything.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7NS5Pi\">\n<em>Superstore </em>views every difference of opinion as an opportunity</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lcj1TmMMG6kAlX1LtFlcrd6uSWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6972129/tara%20superstore.jpeg\">\n      <cite>NBC</cite>\n      <figcaption>Here is a picture of Tara Lipinski not falling.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<p id=\"HFHEwx\">With \"Olympics,\" <em>Superstore </em>also shows how bringing together so many different kinds of people can bring about rich, layered conflicts — not to mention great jokes.</p>\n<p id=\"H5W2Lh\">Like the Dunder Mifflin employees on <em>The Office</em>, almost everyone on <em>Superstore</em> is bound by their desire to just earn a paycheck and/or get through the day already. But there’s more of a sweetness to <em>Superstore</em>, because its characters have come to trust and depend on each other much more quickly than the characters on <em>The Office</em>, whose relationships developed over several seasons.</p>\n<p id=\"tETqug\">Mateo finding out about his immigration status is a great example of what I’m talking about. At first, the storyline is about how Glenn, who’s enthusiastic to a fault, keeps saying that America is the best country in the world as Mateo tries to celebrate his Filipino heritage — and when everyone challenges Glenn to back up that claim, he realizes he can’t. But it’s the Olympics! What better time to tell every other country to, as Glenn puts it with his pleasant version of trash talk, \"eat beans\"?</p>\n<p id=\"TB5f8u\">Then the story takes a turn, with Mateo realizing he doesn’t have the green card he thought he did, right as Glenn tries to make up for being a jingoistic jerk, however well-meaning. And <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/superstore-season-two-nbc-olympics-1201829090/\">according to Spitzer</a>,&nbsp;\"Olympics\" is far from the end of Mateo’s story, which will be an ongoing thread of season two.</p>\n<p id=\"pW1BHB\">I try not to overuse the word \"refreshing,\" since that would negate the point of calling anything refreshing in the first place. But that’s exactly what it feels like to watch <em>Superstore</em>. Any<em> </em>comedy that both embraces its many different viewpoints and celebrates the Olympics by accidentally setting a pyramid of toilet paper on fire is one that deserves room to keep flourishing, in all its plucky glory.</p>\n<p id=\"cJwpYq\">Superstore <em>returns to NBC for a second season on September 22.

We talked about the use and abuse of tropes in genre fiction, what the two changed from the original British series, and what they enjoy about mystery stories.</p>\n<p id=\"1dN4qT\"><em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for content and clarity.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"guSRjo\">On the adaptation process: \"You’re thinking, ‘What would New York do?’\"</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"The Night Of\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CVEqxxm2Nnuy1oMlq7DigDYH6oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6905293/nightof5stone.jpg\">\n      <cite>HBO</cite>\n      <figcaption>John Turturro stars in The Night Of.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"lUqI0I\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"llc7tJ\"><em><a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/the-night-of\">The Night Of</a></em> features a really a great mix of the nitty-gritty of the US criminal justice system and then the more genre-friendly aspects of the mystery story or the whodunnit. How did you balance those two tones, keeping the more realistic stuff in there right next to, say, the parade of suspects or the clues to the murderer’s identity?</p>\n<h3 id=\"XHSMMt\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"DzTRfJ\">You do have to honor the genre, so to speak, even if you're trying to examine it in such detail as maybe you've never seen it before, to really give you a feeling of what it is. But at the same time, [you need to] tell a good story. If you don't have that, then you can do everything else right, and nobody's going to care.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mCsjI8\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"THHVN4\">Everybody in their reviews are lumping us together with this new trend in unfolding real-life crime. This is a fiction, but when we were working on it, we weren't thinking about anything else. I had never heard <em><a href=\"https://serialpodcast.org/\">Serial</a></em>. We did watch [Sundance true crime documentary] <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388644/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">The Staircase</a></em>. But we weren't riding a wave.</p>\n<h3 id=\"EkfMIT\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"qGkjRP\">You start this story so small, then expand it and expand it, and by episode four or five, you’re balancing a whole bunch of different settings. What was the biggest challenge in juggling all of those things?</p>\n<div class=\"align-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"2016 Summer TCA Tour - Day 4\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tzXT9ecohL6vx2V1yrIaQqxcvUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6969619/584698084.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Steven Zaillian.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"IgFJYS\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"UB4mqy\">At a certain point, you've got all of these things in the air, and you have to track each one of those stories and how they interrelate to each other. I would say that the only way that I can do that is to spend a lot of time doing it. It's not something that just does itself, and there's no formula for it. It's just a matter of becoming so familiar with those stories that you start to have a sense of: we need to get back into this part of it, or that part of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"OMqesI\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"ZD74Lm\">If there's one word for that strategy, it's \"meanwhile.\"</p>\n<div class=\"align-left\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"2016 Summer TCA Tour - Day 4\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lbbr97JXIpl629KUaGxprL9SruQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6969621/584698130.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Richard Price.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"S92toe\">You have eight hours. I learned from novels that if you've got a long story and a long road, momentum comes from switching up. The characters in one element of a story are not aware of what's going on in the parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"ktyMSC\">Each rung is slightly above the other rung. When you go [from Naz] back to Stone, it's a little bit above. It gives you more information, then you go back to Naz, and it's a little bit above John Stone.</p>\n<p>It's just momentum. It reflects, intuitively, the storytelling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"yFgERC\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"n1IUo8\">As the show enters the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12399850/the-night-of-episode-5-recap-season-of-the-witch-cat\">trial phase of the story</a>, we watch as Stone and Chandra start to find all these additional suspects. Do you enjoy the puzzle-solving aspects of constructing a whodunnit like that?</p>\n<h3 id=\"Odp9N4\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<div class=\"float-right\"></div>\n<p id=\"anb6zJ\">Absolutely. I watch these real crime shows, <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247882/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Forensic Files</a></em> and things. I can't get enough of them.</p>\n<p id=\"QNRhtF\">I sometimes feel like if I didn't do this, I would love to be a detective. Solving puzzles is what we do as writers, and it's what detectives do on a crime. For us to write about them following clues is great fun and it's challenging and it's satisfying. It's another way to keep everybody on their toes — second and third guessing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"YGepo2\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"rm7xql\">What were some of the biggest elements of the story you had to shift as you were adapting this from the British original to an American miniseries?</p>\n<h3 id=\"0cg8hB\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"Te7d2D\">Obviously the premise is the same. There are certain signposts, certain scenes. But everything around it is particular to [<em>The Night Of</em>], to the point where I have some trouble differentiating one from the other. If somebody says, \"What exactly are the differences?\" I can't even remember, because this has become its own thing.</p>\n<p id=\"nflVN3\">We both liked the British series, but [<em>The Night Of</em>] became its own organic story after that first night of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"BGithS\">For instance, that whole sequence, where [Naz] is dealing with the police is maybe five minutes in the original show. It's 45 minutes in ours.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BTqxAR\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"1KJXBZ\">Everything is five minutes in the original.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LWXRKb\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"SeR8Zx\">We're interested in the details and behaviors of these people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pHm7f5\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"74J3L0\">The big intimidating thing for me is watching <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924210/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Ben Whishaw</a> [the star of the original]. He's such a trembling, white tadpole. But honestly, by the end of the pilot, I forgot all about Ben Whishaw. This is Naz's story.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zSWiey\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"FxF3h7\"><em>The Night Of</em> also uses race, religion, and the melting pot of New York really well. Was it easy to graft that sort of thing onto the original?</p>\n<h3 id=\"uW4vK5\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"VjS9y6\">It's New York. You're thinking, \"What would New York do?\" We made the kid a Pakistani Muslim. What's going to naturally follow from that?</p>\n<p id=\"biUo4I\">We're in Rikers [Island jail]. In the original, it was a generic penitentiary I believe.</p>\n<h3 id=\"69V2V0\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"Yg94Kg\">All white.</p>\n<h3 id=\"qumUdg\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"eoogY9\">Yeah, it was snow white. It was very stylized. This is the exact opposite, but there's no particular racial tension. Rikers is so iconic and if you look up the phrase, \"abandon all hope, ye who enter here\" in a dictionary or Roget's Thesaurus, there'll be a picture of Rikers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CeJUye\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"tEvfGL\">Even with all of its crime dramas, TV rarely goes into the prison setting. What was interesting to you about that world?</p>\n<div class=\"float-left\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"8AZ014\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"C7gfEm\">It was a very pivotal part of the original series. Of course you're going to go there, but you're going to do your own thing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6GqNMC\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"8po1Lw\">Neither one of us went into this saying, \"Oh, we want to do a story about this. We want to expose that. We want to show what Rikers is really all about.\" It all grew naturally from the premise. We're going to follow a case from the moment, the night of the arrest through to the end of the case. You're going to go to Rikers. There's no way to avoid it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7Sx9M0\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"9t8qv1\">And then you talk to people that have been to Rikers. When they tell you the way they get tattoo ink is by melting chess pieces, how could you not use that? God is in the details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4HXSqO\">On dealing with criticism: \"What was dumb there? Running from a crime scene?\"</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"The Night Of\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nmhd0x-nw7kmWmPpnX4TvGhdcpg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6770901/nazcab.jpg\">\n      <cite>HBO</cite>\n      <figcaption>Naz is pulled over by the cops after fleeing the crime scene.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"uBrko4\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"lGnYSM\">One thing that’s really <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/night-of-naz-and-the-dumb-things-he-does.html\">drawn criticism</a> — unfounded criticism, I think — is that in the first episode, Naz does a bunch of things that seem stupid to us because his actions seem to lack common sense. What did you think when you saw people saying he was acting so stupidly?</p>\n<h3 id=\"916RBO\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<div class=\"float-right\"></div>\n<p id=\"DydIzW\">When I saw the British series — and a lot of the premise and certain events in ours are similar to that — I was struck by how realistic it was. I could picture any young person doing that. Doing something stupid is falling for somebody and taking a pill and drinking?</p>\n<h3 id=\"lHBFpa\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"8b7qRL\">I would have done anything to get laid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TqR8bl\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"C0x50F\">What was dumb there? Running from a crime scene? To me, everything that he's doing makes perfect sense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uhUqgF\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"QZ27rq\">People will say, \"That doesn't make sense.\" That's because they're watching it in the comfort of their living rooms. If you wake up from an alcoholic, drugged half-coma and you see evidence of such abrupt and ghastly violence, I'm amazed that Steve didn't have him shit on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"w3IHMz\">He's in a panic, he's in a state of shock. In the cold light of day, the things that he does might seem like, \"Why on Earth did you do that?\" But his brain is in shutdown mode. He's doing the things that a terrified person confronted with a bloody corpse [would do]. Your mind's just like white out. You grab, squeeze, do, run, kick, fight, fly. Anything goes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"om9zob\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"64fWvd\">One of the fascinating things about this show is the way that the character of Andrea just becomes the victim. She’s a cipher — but in a way where it feels like you’re commenting on that trope, or interrogating it. Did you have a larger purpose of what you were doing with that character?</p>\n<h3 id=\"ym9iRz\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"uym23h\">It was inherited from the original. I didn't think too much about it.</p>\n<div class=\"float-left\"></div>\n<p id=\"pm4Fw0\">Then, I started reading [in reviews], \"Once again, it's the anonymous dead girl trope.\" At the time, I didn't think anything about it. It was a murder, and if it was a guy in the bed, I don't think anybody would have said anything.</p>\n<p id=\"Ho9GTn\">The thing is, you can anticipate criticism to the point where you're paralyzed. Sometimes, you're not aware of it until you did it. It's just what the story is. She is supposed to be a mystery. The point of her being a mystery is to look into her background and her life. But, at the end, she as a character is a mystery, and that's one of the things that has to unfold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fPDgzG\">Steve Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"3FWwq7\">She's<em> part</em> of the mystery, too. This was something that was so important to us. You normally go out and you shoot a pilot before you know whether they're going to do the show. But I knew that everything that was going to be shot on that first episode, was going to come back and be examined in great detail. Because it's a murder case, so everything that happens on that night, no matter how innocent it might look, or how subtle a moment is, is going to be reexamined. And so is she.</p>\n<h3 id=\"als4E1\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"b1Uz9K\">She's purposely a cipher in a way. \"Who is this woman?\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"YNd5dm\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"3PW59g\">Just like [every other character]. I had half a mind to start this thing with Naz driving in a taxi cab, so you knew nothing about him. I feel you need to know about everybody by the end, not at the beginning, not at episode two, not at episode five. By the time it's over, you know everything you don't know.</p>\n<div class=\"float-right\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"reBYic\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"SHFS5o\">You’re talking about tropes, and \"trope\" has become kind of this bad word for a lot of critics. But especially in genres, we need some tropes to be able to tell these stories. Where do you find things like tropes and clichés useful, and where do they become problems?</p>\n<h3 id=\"9Xv327\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"CoavMl\">Honestly, it's all in how you treat it. Right?</p>\n<h3 id=\"McMFjP\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"hhjy3S\">Yeah, I mean, there's only so many ways to skin a cat. Especially in crime, some of these tropes are time-honored tropes. I mean, the archetype of noir detectives is he's a loner, possibly a World War II vet. He's got a bottle of rotgut whiskey in his lower drawer. Some dame comes in. But at the same time you honor the trope, you start foiling the expectations of the trope.</p>\n<h3 id=\"0Bv8E9\">On a possible season two: \"If you do something less than [season one], you're going to get your ass kicked\"</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"The Night Of\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z3lnbCMMC6AromV0Ly6xYQTeguI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6870701/nightof4box.jpg\">\n      <cite>HBO</cite>\n      <figcaption>Maybe Detective Box could come back in season two. Maybe not.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"HhNBzZ\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"0BFdn0\">Steven, your direction is really interested in architecture, and all these huge buildings looming over the characters. What drew you to depicting New York in such a way?</p>\n<h3 id=\"KoAajz\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"CDEK0F\">I don't think I consciously thought about that. We found the most interesting locations that we could find and built the most interesting sets that we could build.</p>\n<div class=\"float-left\"></div>\n<p id=\"ATpw3f\">My guiding principle was to make it real as opposed to some sort of ultra-real or heightened reality. To shoot it, not in a documentary way, but in a way that was kind of beautiful and at the same time felt like something.</p>\n<p id=\"W2hXM4\">You could feel it — from the production designers to the DPs, to the actors and their own behavior, which also fits right into that. Their behavior had to befit the place and the situation that they were in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MnMDHb\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"6crVqE\">Richard, <em>The Night Of </em>has been described as novelistic in many reviews, but as someone who's written a number of great novels yourself, what do you miss about novels when you’re writing for the screen? And vice versa?</p>\n<h3 id=\"ekWaSR\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"6NRIUx\">First of all, this thing about TV being the new novel, it's not. TV's television. It's visual. It's two-dimensional. Novels have the land of the interior. When you write a script, it's just stage directions. It's like Western Union, basically. Night, day. Here we are. There we are. Guy says this. A guy does that, cut.</p>\n<div class=\"float-right\"></div>\n<p id=\"S4uYeN\">What novels can give you that film can't is emotion, internal narrative. It's four-dimensional. It goes into the mind of the characters.</p>\n<p id=\"drmbAD\">On the other hand, what film can give you is faces. In this, especially, where just to see Michael Williams or Riz [Ahmed] be scared — just their faces in certain situations wipe out 20 pages of exposition in a novel in a most eloquent way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"f3Ef34\">Todd VanDerWerff</h3>\n<p id=\"bvdlwQ\">The original series had a second installment. Are you at all interested in coming back for another go-round?</p>\n<h3 id=\"bTrsQL\">Steven Zaillian</h3>\n<p id=\"llJ0EF\">My interest in doing this was because I was inspired by the idea of it. I would need to feel that again. I don't at this moment, because I just don't. It would have to be something that I felt was worthy of devoting that amount of time to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2dgyrB\">Richard Price</h3>\n<p id=\"W2xma8\">Steve lived in this thing much more intensely than I did, on set, in the editing room, and locations and casting. I would think if you were to go back into something like this, you have to be ready to go back into that kind of immersion.</p>\n<p id=\"hhZihS\">In terms of there ever being a second season, that depends on a number of things. Coming up with a compelling enough story because this season set a bar so high, in terms of subtlety and quality, that if you can't do that again, why bother? If you do something less than that, you're going to get your ass kicked.</p>\n<p id=\"onMjo2\">The Night Of <em>airs Sundays at 9 pm Eastern </em><em><a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/the-night-of\">on HBO</a></em><em>.

id=\"SzJ3bl\"><em>Originally published on </em><em><strong><a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/what-happens-to-rios-stadiums-after-the-olympics-end/\">Grist</a></strong></em>.</p>\n<p id=\"lnskZA\">Long after the athletes have packed up their Speedos and the torch has gone out, the structures that house the 2016 Olympics will remain. While Rio de Janeiro used its existing national soccer stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies, it also built a number of other stadiums and venues for the games — and displaced 80,000 residents in the process. So what’s to come of all those buildings once everyone has taken their balls and gone home?</p>\n<p id=\"xSj0uG\">The Rio games were billed as a model for sustainability, but they <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/we-were-promised-the-greenest-olympics-ever-we-got-an-ecological-disaster-6fba72f30aad#.4nqhufned\">failed in many respects</a> — from <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/rio-olympics-already-tainted-with-poo/\">polluted waterways</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/02/rio-2016-olympic-games-traffic-jams-vip-lanes-brazil\">nightmarish congestion</a> to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/02/08/384287877/will-the-summer-olympics-fix-rios-problems-or-make-them-worse\">the construction of a golf course on a nature preserve</a>. But one of the more important indicators of an event’s sustainability is what happens to the infrastructure after the games are over — and on that front, Rio has ambitious plans.</p>\n<p id=\"leY3g6\">Future Arena, the handball venue, will be taken apart and the pieces used to build four schools around the city, each serving 500 students. Architect Manuel Nogueira said the Future Arena was built with “nomadic architecture,” designed to be easily dismantled, transported, and rebuilt. “The way everything gets moved from place to another is a bit like Lego,” Nogueira told <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/design/2016/08/rios-plan-to-transform-its-arenas-after-the-olympics-nomadic-architecture-temporary/494963/\">CityLab</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"dYkLMV\">In addition to Future Arena, the city will turn the aquatics stadium into two community swimming centers; the media center will become a high school dorm; and the 300 acres of land on which Barra Olympic Park currently sits will go be turned over for public parks and private development. Repurposing venues like this can be good for both people and the planet: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/08/games-rios-stadiums-wont-rot-theyll-transform/\">According to architect Jeff Keas</a>, who has worked on seven Olympic games, temporary buildings have half the carbon footprint of conventional buildings, and can cost up to 80 percent less.</p>\n<p id=\"9diwlP\">That’s assuming, of course, that everything goes to plan. Other cities have tried to repurpose Olympic venues without much luck. The iconic Bird’s Nest stadium in Beijing, for instance, was supposed to house China’s leading soccer club after the 2008 games, but the team later backed out amid <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/22/world/fg-beijing-bust22\">reports that they were embarrassed</a> to play in an arena built for 91,000 when they averaged 10,000 spectators per game. Now, Bird’s Nest sits empty but for visiting tourists — and still costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/22/birds-nest-empty-monument-china-magnificence\">$11 million</a> a year to maintain.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Beijing Olympic Games Boosts Chinese Tourism\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwG2edxNqqNn68Tzn9K7mhNd57Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6967585/83435616.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by China Photos/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>The Beijing National Stadium, or the Bird’s Nest, was home of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"hFk5yD\">London, too, has run into trouble with its retired venues. While an aquatic center, a velo dome, and a handball arena leftover from 2012 are all open to the public, there has been controversy over the redevelopment of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, home of the Olympic Village and several sporting venues during the games.</p>\n<p id=\"hnqogI\">The park is located in London’s East End, a historically low-income area burdened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/12/toxic-waste-clean-up-olympic\">tracts of toxic land</a> from centuries of exposure to industrial waste. The city (and taxpayers) cleaned up the land for the Olympics, and the plan was for the park to be redeveloped with an emphasis on affordable housing. Instead, London’s erstwhile mayor and Brexiteer <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-25749691\">Boris Johnson announced</a> in 2014 that available housing would be reduced in favor of more commercial development. Now that the land was detoxified for the games, the East End is rapidly gentrifying and lower income residents are being pushed out.</p>\n<p id=\"6gPCNz\">Elsewhere, former Olympic venues have simply been left to rot. Hitler’s Olympic Village in Berlin housed a hospital for German soldiers during World War II, but today, <a href=\"http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hitler-s-olympic-village\">it’s a ruin</a>. The same is true of <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/08/10/abandoned-olympic-venues/#MF7WS14FjqqG\">former venues</a> in Turin, Sarajevo, Athens, Munich, and beyond. You can visit these sites — maybe stand on abandoned podiums and run on Olympic tracks — but that’s about all you can do.</p>\n<p id=\"9muIxC\">Perhaps Rio will not meet such a fortune. But even if the city’s arenas are successfully repurposed, the new buildings are not likely to bring solace to the 80,000 residents — most of them poor — who lost their homes to the Olympics. The games may be a two-week-long show for the rest of us, but for the displaced, the disruption they cause could last a lifetime. A new pool to swim in won’t change that.</p>\n<p id=\"uwUtu8\"><em>Grist is a nonprofit news site that uses humor to shine a light on big green issues.
